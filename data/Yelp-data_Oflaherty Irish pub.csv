"Great selection of beer and a fun place to go after the Sharks game when waiting for traffic to die down. The beer menu, which is large, lists where beers are from as well as their percentage of alcohol which is super helpful!",10/4/2013,Kajal G.,4,0,0,0,170
BeST pub in downtown...really adorable bartender called  Steve.,9/27/2013,Sandra O.,5,0,0,0,1
"Overpriced food and bad service. They were unwilling to discount a burger after messing up the order and taking 30 minutes to bring a new one. The server said it ""wasn't her problem."" Won't be coming back on my next visit to San Jose!",9/7/2013,Tyler L.,1,0,0,0,3
"Trivia night is awesome. I may not look like I know much, but bam! years of religiously watching Jeopardy and mentally inhaling Brain Quest as a child finally paid off.

Also, great bartenders, but drinks are a hit or miss sometimes, so I stick with beer. The crowd here varies depending on the day, but in general, friendly people and interesting characters.

The bathrooms are in the back and shared with the diner next door.

My bf loves Scott the bouncer and would give 5 stars to him alone.",9/2/2013,Tiffaney L.,4,0,0,0,118
"I came here on a Thursday last month when the nice security man was working, who allowed me in even after catching that my driver license expired. He later monitored the bar from the inside and as I was making my way to the restroom, was kind enough to warn everyone to step aside and make some room for me to walk through.
It's a cozy bar with a mini seating area out front. The bar's theme totally slipped my mind that when my friend asked what I wanna drink, I didn't answer with Irish car bomb!
I was told that they offer karaoke but we didn't stay long enough to find out. Next time",8/29/2013,Anh Thu H.,4,0,0,0,21
Heidi is right! Don't order a cocktail here.... My friend and I were walking by and decided to stop here since it seemed fun. (there were lots of people here on a friday night) She ordered a margarita and I got a cranberry and vodka. The bartender looked at us like we were crazy and pushed for us to close out our tab before he even  made the drinks. What the...?? I've never had a bartender do that before. We would have loved to stay there and order more drinks if the bartender wasn't pushy and rude. No thanks! We won't be back.,8/22/2013,A D.,1,0,0,1,42
"I came here on a Saturday afternoon, so the atmosphere was pretty chill except for some rowdy sport fans (but that's what makes it a real Irish pub right?).

I tried the Fruli Strawberry and it was probably one of the best beers I've ever tasted! You can't go wrong with that Belgian brew!",8/20/2013,Jackie K.,4,0,0,0,5
Don't order a cocktail here. It's a whiskey and beer kind of place. Rude bartenders.,8/18/2013,Heidi W.,2,1,1,0,7
"I haven't been much of a drinker lately (not compared to college years!) but I'm a fan of this place.  Occasionally you get a few rowdy/loud patrons but hey..it's an Irish pub! I enjoy their wide selection of beers, liquor, etc.--drinks are reasonably priced and most importantly, the bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly.  I was sitting at the bar, worn out from a day of walking around Christmas in the Park with 5 of my friends and also ready to pass out from the last couple of shots I had and the guy offered me a glass of water..that's the first time t hat I've ever seen that at a bar.  Also is convenient that right next door is a diner, yay! I heard their trivia night is good too",7/31/2013,Kimi K.,4,1,1,1,59
"I decided to venture to San Jose to check out the Annie Leibovitz exhibit at the San Jose Museum of Art.  When I've told people this, they're like, ""You went ALL THE WAY to San Jose?!""  Relax, it's 30-45 minutes away.  

I parked on Santa Clara Street because (1) I noticed Los Gatos Brewing Company, (2) I love breweries, and (3) it's a hop, skip and a jump away from the San Jose Museum of Art.  Sadly, it's closed on Saturdays (um, all of Saturday = prime beer drinking hours, LGBC).  I noticed a sign for a wine bar ""without the pretension"" so I followed it.  Naturally, I like to have a drink before looking at art as it gets those creative synapses firing.  

Before I could find any wine bar I noticed O'Flaherty's (referred to as OFIP in the rest of this review) and quickly changed plans.  The storefront of OFIP is completely open.  This was a welcome change from the 59-degree-in-July weather on the peninsula (which I enjoy 90% of the time), at least for the afternoon.  I always forget that San Jose enjoys 80 degree temperatures in the summer.  

I walked in and looked at the chalkboard for about 5 minutes.  As a bona fide beer-nerd, I must say that their offerings were as extensive as they were impressive. I had just finished reading the chalkboard menu when I noticed another one off to my left.  What?!  I was kind of overwhelmed by the choices--I didn't want to make a bad one.  The bartender walked out from behind the bar and asked if I needed help.  Did I ever!  I asked if he had Pliny the Elder, to simplify things for myself since I know I love that beer.  They didn't have it (shucks).  I asked him for an IPA recommendation.  He suggested the Santa Clara IPA.

At an Irish bar with such a big import selection, I felt kind of lame ordering a local beer, but what the heck.  When in Santa Clara County, do as the Santa Claras do.  (Just kidding, I actually don't know if San Jose is in Santa Clara County.)  It was a solid beer--strangely smooth, rich caramel color, not too dry or hoppy.  Actually, that doesn't really sound like an IPA now does it?  Normally they are dry, bitter, fragrant--biting even.  Hm.  No matter--I'm generally happy with a beer in tow.  

I sat on the sidewalk patio to enjoy my brew in the sunshine.  The bartender even delivered the beer to me versus making me wait at the bar for it.  Ah-the best.  All of a sudden, the car alarm from a blue pick-up truck parked across the street started going off incessantly.  My word--can a girl get a minute's peace?  It would stop for five minutes and then get going again.  Man alive, it was annoying.  A sassy hipster fella walked by and asked the kids 2 tables away from me if he could have a pen and a paper. He proceeded to write a note to the owner of the vehicle.  ""Dear Sir or Madam: I couldn't help but notice your blue truck parked across the street..."" and on and on about how it disturbed his afternoon, but with the politest tone. Haha-nice.

I finished 3/4 of my beer (I never drink the remaining 1/4--always leave that for the homies). I peaced out shortly thereafter.

OFIP has large televisions that you can see from the sidewalk patio with sports ball on (soccer or baseball that day).  It was very full for a Saturday afternoon (Read: day drinking is encouraged).  Unbelievable beer selection.  All in all, A++ environment for hooliganism.  

One little drawback--my beer was $9.00 (*low whistle*). That was almost twice the cost of my ticket to the museum. Thank you, tech industry!  (Note: If your beer is $9, a good tip is $2 per beer, and not $1 per beer.  Only the best for our friends.)

Other than that, loved it.",7/26/2013,Sunny S.,4,0,1,0,134
"Prior to a recent spur of visits, it had been a while since I'd been to O'Flaherty's.

Years, even, since the last time during which I swore off the place, but that's a story left for a 1-star* draft I probably won't ever write now.

The closest facsimile San Jose has to an Irish Pub - at least in decor - O'Flaherty's remains one of those fixtures of downtown's bar scene, so no amount of exposition from me will likely shed any insights on the place that you couldn't read in another of their 250+ reviews or experienced on your own.

On the plus side, they have recently hopped aboard the craft beer trend in the South Bay, amassing 38 or so taps of decent brew. That's a lot of taps and a wide variety for sure, making them a notable outlet for the good stuff, but service here seems dispassionate about it, peddling beer as a commodity rather than promoting the craft of it. Still, it's a welcome addition to the blooming craft beer scene.

It's still one of the best spots to fan-out during Sharks season, otherwise it wouldn't be the first place I go to most nights, but someone I've taken a fancy too likes the place, so you'll find me checking in there on occasion.

Yes, I go there because of a girl. Stop judging me.",7/24/2013,Mikey U.,3,3,3,3,512
"This is the place to go if you like good beer. I always want to try something new or different each time because their selection is amazing. Wednesday night trivia is a blast but come early to nab a table/seat! It can get crowded but I really like the intimate feel of this smaller pub. I will say it: I prefer it over Monday night trivia at the Market for that reason.

My only thing is consistency. I don't come by here too often but a couple of times I've gone in and either they'd be ""out"" of a food item fairly early into the night (I would consider 8PM fairly early?) or another time my friends and I sat down to have dinner and a few beers but they weren't serving food. No big deal, they told us we could have our beers and bring in outside food (super cool of them) but maybe let us know or put a sign up? I'm not as irked when my first choice beer is out, though, because I know I could pick from so many others!",7/10/2013,Hazie W.,4,0,0,0,73
I enjoy this place every time I've come here. It's a great spot with inside and outside seatings. Their drinks are reasonably price and they make a mean vodka cranberry. The customer service has been great each visit. It's located on San Pedro Square next to Peggy Sue's.,6/11/2013,Lisa N.,4,0,0,0,473
"Little loud, lots of drunk guys sort of running into people and grabbing the waitresses, just not really my scene anymore.  For a quick drink not bad just don't plan on hanging out here very often on a saturday night.",6/5/2013,Kristen B.,2,0,0,0,35

"It's a bar...in San Jose. Usually where my friends go if everywhere else is packed. So lots of bar overflow patrons I presume, Also a bar that my friends and I usually end up.

The good:
Great place to catch a hockey game.

The Bad:
I guess its been recently converted to a gastropub now. I just wish they would print their beer menu, its sometimes difficult to read the chalkboard. I guess this is because the beer on draft is constantly rotated, merely a suggestion.",6/3/2013,mark m.,3,1,0,0,54
"Not a bad place to hang out and have a beer or two.

$4.50 for a pint of Lagunitas IPA not bad (Happy Hour prices I believe) not bad.

Several screens for the Sharks game that night (including a big projection screen that comes down from the ceiling)

My only complaint would be that this place isn't very big and can get packed quickly. So if you're not into big crowds in small spaces, this might not be the place for you on a busy night.",5/30/2013,Craig F.,4,1,1,1,151
Just ducked in for a beer and after trying to order an alagash white (which they didn't have for some reason... it was on their specials menu) I just ordered a Guinness and chilled. There was karaoke going on and the crowd was a bit older like 30+ and the song list was huge. It was alright but it didn't make much of an impression on me.,5/29/2013,Manda H.,3,0,0,0,77
"Great Pub!

As soon as you walk in you get hit with the Irish feel. Especially if there's soccer on TV then you really feel like you're in the UK.

They are one of the few places that has Murphy's Stout on tap. I like the friendly bartenders and I like how some of the bartenders will go around and ask you if you want another round or wish to order something else. It makes it so much easier then getting up and standing back in line.

That leads me to the only bad thing about this place, on weekend nights it gets busy and sometimes crowded for a small place. But once you get over that, you'll like this place. A nice spot to grab some brews with your friends and chill at  a table.

Definitely recommend this place.",5/27/2013,Aaron G.,4,0,0,0,2
"This used to be one of my favorite places to go, but no more.

I brought people with me to O'Flaherty's for trivia for over a year, and once in a while on Saturdays to play board games. The waitresses have always been friendly, and my drinks good. Garlic fries are delicious. I always recommended this place to friends for an easy-going night.

My low rating is for the blatant disregard of smoking laws and their ""so what"" attitude when asked very politely to fix it.

O'Flaherty's front walls sort of roll up so there's no separation between the inside and outside. It's a really neat feature, unless there's a lot of smokers on the patio, which on trivia night, there is. Now, I'm fine with people wanting to smoke, and I even overlook that they're right up against the front of the bar, right next to the doors and the usually open doors or rolling wall. I don't expect people who are smoking to go stand in the middle of the street (or however far 20ft is). But, you'd think that the staff would realize that most people don't want to smell the cigarette smoke and keep the rolling walls and doors (when people aren't walking through them of course) closed.

When it first started to become a problem, I talked to a few of the waitresses and I was told the higher-ups wanted to keep the doors and walls open. OK, I sucked it up for another few months until it was really bad one night. I got up to close the door that I wasn't even sitting near, but once I had closed it, one of the bartenders opened the door up again. The thing is, it doesn't seem to be about getting air circulation, since there are ceiling fans that are never on.

I wrote to O'Flaherty's via their website, and got no response. I lodged a complaint with the county, but was told others had complained and the city of San Jose's Code Enforcement wasn't doing anything. The guy from the county said O'Flaherty's probably wouldn't do anything until they get ""sued, fined or closed"" (his words, not mine). I called San Jose's code enforcement, and got no response from them either. I'm really sort of disappointed that O'Flaherty's would ignore requests to shut doors to stem cigarette smoke. I didn't curse, I didn't scream. I wrote letter just like this one. I talked to numerous people about the problem before I made a formal complaint. I didn't have to go that far, but I did because I felt I wasn't being taken seriously by the staff. Apparently I wasn't the only one pushed to that extreme by this bar.",5/17/2013,Jen L.,1,1,0,0,14

"I was in town recently for a concert and me and some friends decided to meet here before hand. The place was PACKED with people. The whole staff was friendly, especially Marcus.

"Definitely not a fan.  I came here before a Sharks game and the service and selection was terrible.  They run out of beers quickly and the ones left over aren't usually worth paying for... If you are in the area or looking to find somewhere fun to visit before a game, I recommend spending your money elsewhere.",4/29/2013,Alyx F.,2,0,0,0,347
Friendly service and patrons... and most importantly a proper Guinness pour. They have a very nice selection brews on tap and next time I'll venture beyond Guinness and try them. O'Flaherty's is a cool pub though I can imagine it gets crazy before Pavilion events.,4/4/2013,Paul R.,4,0,0,0,169
"$5 Car Bombs on Sundays!!!!

I love this spot for just chilling on a lazy Sunday!  The bartenders can make the Guinness into a 4 leaf clover, pretty awesome!  I like coming here around 3PM on a Sunday when there's no crowds so I can't speak for the night crowds.",3/18/2013,Katie N.,5,0,0,1,201
"Sooo many beer on tap. If you're interested in beer tasting or just trying new beer, come check this place out. They probably don't have as many as Yard House but it's definitely more than you can drink a night. There's a beer for everyone whether you like stouts, pilsners, belgians, IPAs, fruity beers, amber, etc... The waitresses and bartenders are always nice there so far I've been there the past few times. I think they also serve food during the day.

They have live music sometimes and DJs that spins on weekends. Everyday (or weekday) there's an event. I believe they have karaoke and trivia nights. I haven't been on there on those nights so I can't tell you much about that.

Oh! And if you're a whiskey fan, they have a bunch of different whiskey: Scottish, Irish, aged...",3/18/2013,Vivian D.,4,0,0,0,92
"Great pub in san pedro square. I like to come here after original gravity public house closes as it closes a lil early for my liking and its got almost as great a selection o beers to keep me comin back. The weekends are pretty crowded and since its an Irish pub its not really my scene, but if you want a chill place to relax n kick back some brews you should stop by on the weekdays where the service will be more spot on and the environment will be more relaxed.",3/18/2013,Frank L.,4,1,1,1,144
"It's not their fault that they are so popular, but this place gets packed!  I really love the great variety of beer they have on tap.  Be prepared to fight to get your beer though!  It gets so crowded!",3/14/2013,Jennifer S.,3,0,0,0,580
"Lazy bartender.

Lying ass bartender.

$15 for a personal sized pizza.

"This place seems like it could be really cool, but today it didn't deliver.

We were in town for an appointment and I looked up Irish Pub's on Yelp in anticipation of our upcoming vacation to Ireland.  This place seemed to fit the bill nicely.

We went on a Wed. afternoon for a pint or two and some lunch.  When we walked in, there were a few people sitting at the bar, but no bartender, no server or hostess, and no sign indicating to seat ourselves or order at the bar.  After several minutes, the bartender finally came out and took our order.  I let him know that we wanted to eat, so he gave us the menu card.   After taking our drink order, we watched as the bartender went behind the bar and changed his shirt.  Not cool...

The menu had very few choices, it was literally a card.  I had the cheeseburger and she had a Caesar salad.  Food came out in decent time, but was marginal quality at best.  My cheeseburger was was too greasy, and her salad looked like it came straight out of a bag from the Safeway produce aisle.  

On the bright side, and what got this place two stars instead of 0 or 1, they had a great beer selection.  I had a Murphy's and an IPA (cant remember the name, but really good), and she had a patron margarita.  

After we left, we decided that we're not going to give this place another chance the next time we're in town.  The prices were a little high for what we got ($50.00 for two beers a maragrita, salad and a burger), the service was bad (we felt like we were imposing on the bartender/server when we made our order) and the food wasn't great.  I hate to give bad reviews, and I'm glad that some people seem to like it...I really wanted to like the place as the atmosphere and decor seemed really cool, but I think we'll try something else next time",2/13/2013,Mike H.,2,0,0,0,11
"This place is one of the cool little pubs downtown San Jose. I think my favorite part of O'Flaherty's is that they serve quite the bit of beers and it reminds me a lot of a pub in England or Ireland. They have some cool specialty beers and ciders which you can only get here.

O'Flaherty's gets so lively after the Sharks play a game. If you have never experienced this place after a sharks game, especially a win, than make sure to go there after one of the games even if you don't go. It is way cool to see all the fans in their gear and when they have just won the is such a buzz in the room that you feel like you are at a party.",1/29/2013,Aron H.,5,1,0,2,294
"Come here with a good group of friends for a drink or a beer and you'll have fun. They have dice games that are always fun to play and their drinks are made well. Not every bar I go into knows how to make an Old Fashioned, but they did and they made it well. This isn't really the place to meet people though because it seems like everyone here is in their own little world. They also have live music often, especially during the summer months.",/27/2013 ,Tim W.,4,0,0,0,29
"There are some basic things I require from a good Irish pub (besides Guinness on tap, or it doesn't even qualify). O'Flaherty's met them all:

-- A friendly vibe...Check
-- A good beer list...Double Check! (O'Flaherty's beer list was over-the-top and amazing)
-- A cute waitress with an Irish accent...Check!
-- This waitress had great timing, and asked us if we'd like another one before our glasses were fully drained - check!

The food wasn't great, but that's not really a requirement of a good Irish pub, is it? - having any food at all is just extra credit; My buddy had a fish and chips, and I had a try-tip sandwich. Both were fine and met our needs.

And with cheap parking across the street, O'Flaherty's has become my new pre-HP Pavilion spot!",1/25/2013,Dan B.,4,10,6,8,863
"Real chill. I like the Irish pub look, feel and brews.

I came here on St. Patrick's Day and although they had a $10 cover charge, I had a blast. I don't know if the back patio is normally open, but on this specific day it was (which made sense). They had a mini bar set up and a fast delivery bartender. The heat lamps, tables and porter pottys were super necessary and gave me and my friends a comfortable place to chill. There was a TON of people celebrating the Irish holiday so they also opened up the second floor and the bar upstairs. The 2nd floor you ask? Yes, I was equally surprised. There's a stage and full bar up there! I don't know if it's part of O'Flarhery's or another venue, but it's super dope. There's a dance floor by the stage and the stage is low so it feels intimate. On St. Patty's, they hired a U2 cover band! I had a jolly good time that night and because of that I've dropped in every time I'm at San Pedro Square.

Pint of Guiness for me, please.",1/3/2013,Steph V.,5,3,0,1,335
Excellent Irish Pub with very friendly staff and a host of Craft Beers and a Beer club. They have the Trivia on Wed's and other events throughout the week. Highly recommended.,1/2/2013,Gautam A.,4,1,0,1,10
"Normally, I'd call O'Flaherty's just another Irish pub in the Bay Area (why are there so many, anyhow?) but their recent addition of craft brews on tap have earned them a place in my bar rotation.  Last time a buddy and I stopped in, they had Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA. If you know beer, you know that one is a recipe for both good times and disaster.

Best of all, parking here is not an issue as there is a huge parking structure across the street.

My only beef? Their service can be lackluster at times for no reason, so they get three stars.",11/28/2012,Edgar N.,3,2,1,0,213
"I've been going here for Trivia night on Wednesdays and I like this place. It's A-OK in my book!

+ Craft Beers
+ Decent Beer Selection
+ Good atmosphere

- Wait staff is ok
- Layout of the place is ok
- Lacks a certain something

This place is OK, I'd come here but it would not be my first choice. I think it lacks a distinct feel. Not a neighborhood bar like Trials, not a sports bar like the Brit, not a craft brew pub like Original Gravity, not a dive bar like Caravan... it's unique in that it's not unique.",11/27/2012,Jack T.,3,1,0,0,151
Love the place and love the bar. The bartenders are nice and always there when you need a drink. The food is also pretty good. Only downside is a bit pricey when happy hour isn't going on. Overall one of my favorite places in San Jose.,10/22/2012,Ryan V.,4,0,0,0,7
"This is my new favorite neighborhood bar. The crowd is quite eclectic and isn't filled with the typical Downtown San Jose crowd/scene. Often times, they have random bands that play. Some good, some not so good. I thought Analyze Generator was an awesome band, unbeknownst to me was my coworker's son's band. Small world!

Also, they have awesome deals on certain days, which is great on the pocket book.

They have an awesome waitress who always knows what we like to drink. Her uncanny skills to recollect certain drink orders from certain patrons is quite amazing. She is also super friendly! She is probably the best bartender/waitress at any bar I have ever been to and she has a nice rack that I tend to stare at. No lesbo.

I recently grew a penchant for Irish Car Bombs. Mind you I am not much of a drinker because I do not like the taste of alcohol. But, HOT DAMN, their Irish Car Bombs taste like chocolate and two of these get me quite tipsy. Even though I find myself quite humorous when sober, I have been told I am awesomely funny while drunk. So ... yeah, yay for chocolate tasting alcohol to make me the life of the party! ",10/22/2012,Angel C.,5,1,0,0,93

"Came here around 2pm on a Saturday for a Magners and the drink was good, but the people working sucked. The bartender was rude and was angry with us for not tipping even though we were still drinking.

"Came here on a whim today on my way to get pizza, the bartender was super cool, gave me a sample of some good local beer(I didn't ask it's name) and gave us good suggestion on a place to get pizza!!! Price isn't terribly expensive for one beer and a pepsi(for my gf) about 6.50 I believe. The place looks really nice and though night time drinking won't be on my to do list here(or anywhere. I'm a day time sit back and enjoy drinker) I'll definitely be here during the day more often!!! That beer was damn tasty!",8/30/2012,Adrian A.,4,0,0,0,36
"Let me start off by saying, this should be a a 2 or 3 star review. But, it isn't, only because I go on Sundays & Mondays (karaoke night) and the KJ, Ryan, is awesome. There are also a bunch of really cool friendly people who come to sing and get trashed, so, that's all lovely and good.

Getting trashed... that brings me to my next point. I don't understand how anyone gets tipsy, let alone trashed. They must be sneaking in flasks. The mixed drinks are WEAK, in my experience. My sis claims that they were strong when she came once, I however, am never going to find out if this IS in fact ever true, because I will never stop regretting the amount of money I spent last night just trying to achieve and maintain a good buzz.

However, the beer selection is good, and I'm definitely sticking with that from now on.

The bartenders are nice, I really do like them despite the fact I'm more comfortable with them pouring me a beer than mixing me up an old fashioned... And one of them can sing just like Amy Lee :)

My last little complaint is in regards to the high percentage of creepers who seem to hang out here. Maybe there should be a bouncer stationed at the door with someone there to give a brief psychological evaluation before entry is permitted, because, for whatever reason this place seems to attract men who are a little off.

I've had several weird experiences with creepy dudes, but last night I was mildy entertained when some stranger first tried to rub my shoulders and then stroke my hair, despite my protests - entertained, only because it gave me the opportunity to tell him off, and, better yet, watch my big (ex-military) sister cuss him out for me.",8/20/2012,Jenice P.,4,1,1,0,48
Good luck getting a drink on a busy night.  My cup runneth dry and stayed that way.  I actually saw the bartender put a customer in check because the customer was trying to get his attention.  Kinda rude.,8/13/2012,Sheryl M.,2,1,0,0,217

Awesome place to chill and have a good conversation over a beer!  The music is awesome and so is the crowd.  Bar tenders are friendly and so is the bouncer at the door.  Great whiskey selection.  Everything perfect for a Irish pub.  I'll be back...,7/19/2012,Hari A.,5,0,0,0,8
"Went here Saturday night to see a friend's band play. I loved the vibe of this bar! It's a super open layout, so if you're outside or in it all feels connected. On the night I was there, they were trying to make room for a bunch of kegs so they were selling bottled beer for $1.50. You heard me right! That was a huge hit.

Bartenders were attentive, but I can't speak for their drinks because I only got a bottle that night. I'll go back when I'm trying to get cray and see how it is. But my friend was happy with her drink!

My friend's band was great (Analyzer Generator, check them out online if you're curious!), and so was the band before them. Good live music is always a plus in my book and this bar often has a band playing. Great location, on San Pedro's in downtown SJ. Right next to Peggy Sue's and Old Spaghetti Factory! I definitely want to come back here and catch the good vibes again. :)",7/18/2012,Nora H.,5,0,0,0,128

"Blah blah blah.

You've been in a million Irish-themed pubs.  Most of them were the same.

So here we go: O'Flaherty's is a genuinely pleasant, reasonably authentic execution of an oft-aped genre of drinking establishment.  The bartender is friendly and competent.  The patrons are personable and pleasant.  The ambiance is suitable and appropriate.  They have Jameson's Whiskey on tap. (No, that is not a typo.  It is not on line yet, but they are set to have Jameson's available on a beer-style tap.)  The patrons are friendly, and depending on their disposition and state of inebriation, intelligent.  

A solid drinking establishment.

"Oooh man...I'm a regular here now. Does that make me an alcoholic!?

NO! that just means that this is an awesome pub.

I LOVE the music that they play here. They play a lot of Chili Peppers, Radiohead, and Audioslave. They do not completely blast the music here either so it's easy to hold a conversation. Its also a great environment to watch games. They have plenty of big TV's here and a good deal of tables and chairs.

The pub has a patio where you can chill outside and drink. You never have to worry about it being too stuffy or the air circulation being bad. Even on the MOST crowded nights (St. Patty's Day), the pub does not get too stuffy because there is no wall that separates the patio from the inside.

I've been to O'Flaherty's during the day when it is COMPLETELY empty, and during St. Patty's Day when it is COMPLETELY filled, and I must say, I've enjoyed both experiences a lot! The only thing holding this place back from 5 stars are the happy hour prices. It's not as cheap as I thought it would be.",5/13/2012,Jeffrey W.,4,0,1,1,58

"DON'T GO ON ST. PATS!

Great business sense, really, but they certainly don't have any specials going on during St. Patrick's day, and I suspect they jack up the prices a bit. They also ran a 15 dollar minimum charge on credit cards (which they neglected to mention when I called to ask if they took credit), and were selling beers for 7 bucks a pop, meaning you had to keep your tab open for at least three beers. It was also more crowded than a Columbian brothel.

I'd like to go back again on a non-holiday, just to see how everything is without the insanity of a good 120 patrons more than the fire marshal suggests. Ambiance is great, and I suspect the service might be alright when they don't have to cater to 250 drunken folk at one time.",4/19/2012,Sean D.,2,1,0,1,3
"The only thing saving this from being one-star is the great variety of whiskeys they have. I had plenty of time to study all of them, because it took me a whopping thirty minutes before any of the bartenders took my order. I came in early for trivia night, before it was really crowded. I was standing in plain sight, and even when I moved up flush against the bar and pointedly tried to make eye contact or flag someone over, I was ignored. Only when my friends came in did someone finally come over.

He took our orders, and then promptly forgot them. He gave everyone else their drinks, and then got sidetracked and abandoned me. The other bartender on duty said ""sorry, it'll be a couple more minutes because a lot of people just came in"". Okay, so they JUST came in. They weren't waiting thirty minutes already. And they came in AFTER I had already ordered. They were clearly friends of the bartenders, as they hung around the laptop (for trivia?) and slightly behind the bar. They got all of their drinks before mine was finally finished. 45 minutes total.

When they finally did give me my Rob Roy, it and the Irish Apple I got for a friend were both half the usual size, for slightly more than the usual price.

The trivia is not worth all the trouble. It's not as fun and multimedia as Dive Bar's, and the hostess goes on and on about inconsequential things. I know that every place has that ""quiz master is always right!"" rule, but usually when they're blatantly wrong, they admit it and concede the point. When the quiz master here mixed up the Pantheon and the Parthenon, despite a very loud outcry from an overwhelming majority, she rudely bitched ""if you don't like it, you can leave"". So we did. And I probably won't ever willingly come back.",4/5/2012,Cat N.,2,5,0,0,381

"The first Irish Pub I've been to stateside!

Not even going to compare it to the ones in Europe, but I still had fun.

Came here with a boy and drinks were rather pricey compared to what I'm used to paying in France -- good thing I didn't have to pay.

We came here on a Sunday night, and it was one of the only places that was somewhat busy in the area. Karaoke night!!

Beers on tap are $6 each.
Shots of Patron Silver were $9
Tokyo Tea (I think) was $8-$10?

The Tea really did me in, and I only had half of one. First and only time I'm ever drinking one of those!

The bartenders were really nice and laid back, service was quick, and patrons are a bit on the ""older"" side. Considering I'm on the lower end of the drinking spectrum.

"Three Words .. Irish - Car - Bomb.

Irish Car Bomb's are 'the bomb' if you WANT to get BOMBED out of your SKULL!!!!!!

Hubby and I have been coming here for YEARS (our FAVORITE PUB) and never heard of this drink ... till TUESDAY, that is!!!  
I asked our lovely waitress for something ""different"" (boy, I really NEED to go to Singlebarrel, LOL!) and she suggested the Irish Car Bomb.  We ordered one for each, and a Smithwick's  (God Bless the Irish!!) chaser.

Yes, a pint as a chaser ... YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT????

We get the drinks-a shot glass filled with half Jameson's and half Bailey's PLUS half a pint of Guiness.  You drop the shot in the Guiness and chug a lug.  Sounds totally gross, but it tastes like whipped chocolate mousse ... SERIOUSLY!!!!!!  So good, I ordered another one ... BEFORE I drank my Smitty's.  BIG MISTAKE!!!
Or, maybe not, if you are the type who doesn't like to remember dinner ... hmmmm.

Seriously, this place is FANTASTIC!!!  

Their Black and Tans are made with Guiness and Smithwick's.  I've already told you about their 'mixed drinks'!  We have also had the pleasure of listening to their live Irish band.

"Pretty cool little Irish Pub in San Pedro Square.  Everyone is really friendly.  It's a small space, but it's also quite nice.  The food menu has like...6 items, so you won't have to think too much.  Also, if you want food, you might want to just go to LG Brewing Company...since that's where they get their food from anyways (apparently used to be Peggy Sue's...).  The try tip sandwich is pretty good, but note that because of the aforementioned 'using someone else's kitchen,' your food will show up in a to go box.  Fries are okay, but a little soggy.  They've got a good number of TVs, lots of channels, and are great about putting on what you request.

Wednesday is trivia night, and they have other nights throughout the week for other entertainment (that I can't remember offhand right now).  Like them on Facebook for $2.50 drink specials.  Decent selection of beers.",1/22/2012,Brian B.,4,1,0,0,679

"WOW! This place was a great find in Downtown San Jose. I was starting to doubt that there was a good cozy Irish pub around there... but I was clearly wrong.

This was my first legit Irish coffee and now I have quite the high standard...!! It was perfect on a cold night.

Apparently there is live Irish music on Tuesday and Sunday evenings, so I plan to come back and listen one night while enjoying another fine coffee.

The bar is a bit farther from the loud and crazy busy downtown (a couple blocks down from Xmas in the Park and they ""CARD"" you before you enter.. sorry, no under 21 allowed!

We all ordered their Irish coffee, I don't remember when was the last time I had an Irish coffee..but here at O'Flaherty's ... wooooo strong and DELICIOUS!! I loveeee that they didn't skimp on the alcohol BUT it was not overwhelming and I could still taste the coffee and love the cream on top.. a perfect night cab (or shall I say, dessert? lol).

"What kills me is when people expect the atmosphere of their precious ultra-lounges at a bar/pub.  It's in the name here kids, ""PUB"".  An Irish pub at that.  So what we can conclude is that simple unadulterated drinking is priority #1 here.  This is one of very few spots in San Jose that has that genuine bar feel - and smell.  What you see is what you get.  Personally, I love that!

On one visit, I was even given a lesson, by the staff, in history and culture when I inquired about the fundamental difference between Bushmill's and Jameson's.  Woo-eee, did I open a can of worms with that question!

It's one of the great spots in San Jose that works as a place to start the night from, end the night at, or just spend the entire night there.  I can think of several times I've met people here after work for happy hour and the next thing I knew, I was hearing ""last call!""  (Haha, oops!)

I thought I would like this place, because the bartenders seemed friendly. I understand that Hween is a busy night, but that makes it even more important for the staff to keep their energy up. They looked exhausted and it was only 1030! In addition, it wasn't even that busy. To top it off, the drink I ordered was mostly soda. That's great if you want a yummy drink, but I like mine to have some bite. Overall. I would say the atmosphere was mediocre, just like the other times I've been there.

"We stopped by before heading over to Strikeforce. It was around 6pm, and almost every bar stool was occupied by men and their beer. It was nice out and I like their patio on the sidewalk. I've never really been in an Irish pub before but it's definitely different and it's not bad at all. It gives off that cozy vibe and it's nicely decorated. The bartender was nice, although it feels like if you're not the one they helped, they don't really acknowledge you. I'm not really bothered by that since it does happen at other places as well. I ordered a 'Long Island' and it wasn't as strong tasting as most places (that's a good thing) but it did get me a little buzzed. Yes, I'm a lightweight when it comes to drinking lol. They give you a bowl full of pretzels and salted peanuts. They have the popular beers on tap. There's plenty of tables for you to sit down at and hang out.

We are wasted. We were already toasting to everything we could think of just for a reason to cheers.

The next toast as my cousin and his 2 dude friends entered?

""To Michael's boyfriend!""

As we all stood and clinked pints, the next table over, 2 couples on a date, stood up as well and clinked glasses with all of us.

Once again, ""To Michael's boyfriend!""

Everyone at the bar, sitting on barstools also got up and raised their pints and glasses high.

"It has potential. It can be a good bar sometimes. Some bartenders are good. Others, not so much.

The crowd is OK most of the time.

The drinks are relatively expensive. Beers on tap are $6. Bottled beers are cheaper but come in a very limited selection.

I believe hard-liquor drinks start at $8. Pours are carefully measured and free drinks are very hard to come by.

After going here almost weekly for three years and tipping at least $3 per drink, I think I got two free drinks total, ever.

If this is a friendly, neighborhood Irish pub where ""you're only a stranger but once,"" I want better cheap beer choices, generous pours and a free drink now and then for loyal costumers and good tippers.

I  have dropped O'Flaherty's from my regular rotation of downtown bars, but I plan on visiting again to see if things have improved. Last two or three times I was there, they were out of the beer on tap that I requested and the crowd was lacking a vibe.

"Great atmosphere, great service, and friendly people.

In my opinion, the best pub in San Jose.  It is always my first choice for a place to go for a pint with friends.  On the right night, you can walk into O'Flats and enjoy one of the most authentic pub experience to be had in the Bay Area.  Sunday and Tuesday nights are their traditional music nights.  Most of the time it is a rather quiet, laid-back pub to enjoy drinks and conversations at.  Weekends and nights with a Sharks game can get crowded, but that is to be expected with any place that is located so close to central downtown.

"This place is normally a 3-star pub. But I must deduct one full star after this Monday and Tuesday of this week. More on that later in this review.

I have been coming here for several years. I have once or twice had an amazing time here, but I definitely had to pay for it  (since this place can be pretty bland at times and alcohol helps make it more fun). Most of the time, I have an okay time. And I can honestly admit, I have never had a terrible time at O'Flaherty's.

It's a very relaxed, laid back atmosphere and for most part, attracts a very nice, friendly crowd. But there isn't a much to do but drink here. But hey, it's an Irish pub, so I guess that fits the bill.

Unfortunately, for an Irish pub, O'Flaherty's does not seem to care that much for St. Patrick's Day. I came here on Monday night with some soccer teammates hoping to to have an Irish Car Bomb are two, chat about the game, and of course, bring in St. Patrick's Day early.

Upon arrival at 12:10 A.M., the bartender rings a bell. I assume he just got a huge tip or something. But the bell was actually for ""last call."" That is pretty damn early for a local watering hole.

It was not that slow for such a small place. They still had 10 or 11 people at the bar and I had a small group of 3 with me. That's basically turning business way. But hey, it was Monday and maybe they were prepping for a long day tomorrow. Fair enough.

Yesterday, which was St. Patrick's Day, after a super sober experience at Boswell's, I head over here from Cambell and I see a good crowd and proceed to walk inside. I am excited.

I am ready to consume my first St. Patrick's Day drink. As soon as I walk in around 12:15 A.M. and the bell goes off. The bartender called last call at 12:15 A.M. on St. Patrick's Day? Really?

Does the owner of this bar not care about St. Patrick's Day (even though this is an Irish Pub)? Or maybe he could care less about his customers? Or maybe he doesn't care about money (even though it's green)?

Whatever the reason, this place does not deserve to be called an Irish pub. I want to rename it Grandpa Willy's Bar or something that makes it seem like an old man's bar, since this place seems to like to obviously go to bed early.

"If I'm not going to Firehouse, then I'm going here. Where else can I relax with a pint of perfection in a casual, friendly atmosphere that isn't bombarding me with obscenely loud music? Granted, obscenely loud music has it's time and place, but sometimes, having a fresh glass of Boddington's, some salty pretzels, and live Irish folk music is just what the doctor ordered.

Although the menu is somewhat small, all the food I've had here has been great pub food. The Guinness Stew, Sheppard's Pie, Calamari - all good.

I vaguely remember a back patio from a few summers back when the international rugby tournament was in town - after the last match, all 3 teams came to drink here. So many people, that Ray opened up the back, and even to the upstairs theater. Granted, I was drunk and it was a long time ago, so I just might be mistaken. However, if I'm not, they should definitely open the back up more often. Otherwise, don't go changin'!",3/6/2009,Nicholas T.,5,0,0,0,14
"Every time I come here everyone is laid back and in a good mood.  What a great place to watch the Sharks game if you don't have tickets.  The bartenders are quick and extremely down to earth. I had the bad luck of losing my honeys phone but the good luck that I lost it at the Firehouse, because within minutes we had it back.  Definite place to go to meet some nice laid back people, or watch a game.",2/27/2009,Nydia N.,5,0,0,0,5
"o'flats is the best to hang out before and after Sharks games. i've spent many seasons watching games at the bar as well and there's always good company and plenty of Guinness and Smithwicks. just the way i like it!

Ray O'Flaherty is the nicest gent ever as well! i usually see him at the end of the bar chatting up with someone or sometimes even down the street at the Firehouse. their slogan is also TOTALLY true ""you're only a stranger but once."" even when i'm not going as frequently everyone still remembers me which is always refreshing.

this is also my favourite place to hang out on St. Pattis. great place to see the pipers walk by whilst having a few pints.",2/26/2009,Karen N.,5,0,0,0,59
"Ahh, O'Flaherty's! My pub gem in San Jose's silly meat market club scene. You won't walk in and feel like a naughty dog in an episode of Cesar Millan's ""Dog Whisperer.""

Ruffian loitering outside of club: ""Tssst! TSSSSSSST!!!""
Me: ""Grrr! GRRRRRR!!!""

It's relaxed but still lively. The bartenders are funny and friendly when there's time for chit-chat and polite and efficient when it's busy. The crowd runs the gamut from engineers to hipsters to college kids to old guys who can drink you under the table--and none of them are there to be seen or to bother you if you just want a chill drink with your friends. You can have a pint of properly pulled Guiness and watch a rugby match. The bathrooms are generally clean and there are multiple stalls so the line to break the seal is never ridiculous. In short, it's everything I want in a bar that's so hard to find in San Jose; an unpretentious jeans and hoodie island in a sea of bubble dresses and Affliction shirts.

Thank you, O'Flaherty's! You're one of the few reasons I haven't completely given up drinking locally.",2/20/2009,Katie T.,5,0,0,1,33
"A nice little pub in a boring as hell city.  I wish this pub were closer to me.  It's a fun place to hang out.  They have a good happy hour, all kinds of Irish Whiskeys, good beer selection, nice pub atmosphere, live traditional Irish music a couple times a week (unlike other Irish pubs in the area), and despite comments in other reviews saying ""there's no Irish working here""...well, there are some Irish employees, just not all of them, and additionally, the owner himself (Ray O'Flaherty) is from Ireland and can often be seen hanging out in his pub.

I also like that this place is not inundated with loud TVs.

The only thing that brings this down to 4 stars from 5 is that the food is just ""ok"". It's not bad, by any means, but there's definitely nothing exceptional about it either.",2/9/2009,Greg R.,4,0,0,0,26

"A solid pub option for downtown San Jose.

I went here a few nights before Christmas with two friends (and about a half hour before a Sharks game ended, as it turned out).  O'Flaherty's has several tables and a handful of stool-and-barrels for patrons to sit at, in addition to the bar space.  Once the Sharks fans poured in, the space felt fairly crowded.

The tap featured a couple of good beers, and the bartenders were friendly given the influx of people.  I would definitely come back here again on a non-game night to enjoy a quieter drink.",12/28/2008,Bill H.,3,0,0,1,684

We were in and out after 2 speedy rounds. She chugs faster than I do- that takes skills... ahem, if you know-what-ahh-meanz. [shh, don't tell her I said that.]

Didn't stay long to really absorb the atmosphere, but from the looks of it everyone seemed to be enjoying a chill night out at the pub. They also offer free pretzels. Anything free deserves at least 1 star, right?",12/25/2008,Caro M.,4,2,3,2,234

Last night for about 30 mins. It was a bitter sweet drop in for a beer with a co-worker.

"I've never been to Ireland, but walking into this place seems like entering another world.  At first glance, it seems so similar to Firehouse just a few doors down, but inside, the much quieter (though still pretty loud) atmosphere, the dark drinks they have on tap, and the very cool tables and chairs tell me this place is special.

With the group I met here, everyone was ordering little side dishes and small meals, and the food quality wasn't overwhelming, but if I was hungry enough and the price was low enough, I'd eat here.  After a pint or two, I couldn't tell good food from bad anyway, so I'm probably not one to judge a pub.

Since this place is just across the street from the San Pedro parking lot, and since there's plenty of seating and wide open spaces, I could easily picture myself coming here time and again.

I may have no Irish blood, but you can bet I'll be back again.

Ps.  All the tables are converted sewing machines.  With the turning wheels still working.....I had endless minutes of fun pedaling....it had an addictive resistence...much like popping plastic bubble wrap, hahaha",11/24/2008,Tetsu N.,3,3,4,3,386
"That's it, its a pub.
Only things available are beer, beer and more beer.
Happy hour apparently ends at 6pm so we were late when we got there. There's only a few things in the food menu and from tasting the garlic fries, I wouldn't be surprised if they just pulled it out of a frozen bag from Costco, add salt, pepper and 1/10 of a clove of garlic and slap 4$ on it.

Nice location, right in front of the parking structure. No street parking.
I did hear there's a ton of people who come here during Sharks games, there's only 1 flatscreen in the back  and people come here to watch during the games?",11/24/2008,Dennis O.,2,6,7,5,344
"How can you go wrong with an Irish pub?  Answer - you really can't.  Well, unless it's a pseudo-Irish pub.  But O'Flaherty's is definitely the real deal.  Great place to wander into during the summer (or even winter, hell, this is California...) when the front is open.  The bartenders and waitstaff are friendly and first-rate, and there are plenty of beers on tap.  It can definitely get packed (and holy christ, look out on St. Patty's Day...), but that's just more of an opportunity to make new friends!  Assuming, of course, that your new friends are okay that you met when you stepped on their foot and spilled Guinness all over them.  But that's just quibbling.

"Alright you guys, I reeeeallly like this place. I mean it, I really do. The atmosphere is cool, the beer is good and it's close to the HP which makes it an awesome place cool place to head to after a Shark's game. Now here comes the ""but"": The one (and only) thing I find troubling about this place is the smell. I'm serious, it really smells sometimes. I have been here 3 or 4 times now..the first time we were there it was a hot summer day and it was filled with lots of sweaty people and a band who looked like they maybe hadn't showered in days. The stench was pretty bad then, so we opted for a little table under the awning outside. We left, happy and with bellies full of yummy food and beer, planning to head back when it wasn't so crammed with people trying to beat the heat so we could sit inside and enjoy the atmosphere that brought us there in the first place. The second (and third) time we went back it still stunk! What the heck!? I don't get it.....it's a mystery to me. Honestly, the last time we went there, a couple weekends ago, the smell was so bad, especially in the hall on the way to the bathroom that my friend became ill and she left. Thankfully, my sense of smell isn't connected to such a severe gag reflex or else I would miss out on a cool place. I will continue to suck it up (not literally, of course), and keep going back here if I'm in downtown SJ, but I wouldn't mind it if the mystery stench was demystified and taken care of .

I definitely have a soft spot for any place that makes me feel 21 again! Oh sigh!

This is a great bar to chill and just hang with friends without having to talk over the crazy loud music or the crowds of stylistas swarming to get to the dance floor, because there really isn't one. Not that I'm one to dis a fashion forward girl, as I am one of those from time to time. It's just sometimes you just want to relax with some buddies over a cold one.

"Typical Irish Pub. Located along the San Pablo Square right in front of the garage parking that charges you a small fee after 10pm i believe.  ( It used to be free!! sigh ) There are seats/umbrellas in their outside patio.  The inside is pretty spacious but the place can be packed so it can get tedious.  Bartenders are pretty chill but very busy.  I only drank a glass of beer here and some other mixed drinks.  This is a place mostly for beer drinkers!  

Everytime i pass by that place though, I always get random people trying to get me to come in and join them to get a drink..not the workers there, but people who are sitting/chilling/drinking that ask me... how weird.. maybe i should take up on free drinks offer next time?

"Almost gave O'Flats 4 starts, but I have grown quite fond of this place over the few years I have been going semi-regularly.  It is a good stop before going somewhere else, around 10 to 11pm is nice.  Since its on the way home, one last beer here at 1:30 is not uncommon.  They will usually serve pretty late, unlike a few other places that quit 1:15am (which is infuriating).

I don't hit this place much when its crowded, though the crowds tend to be much more tolerable.  Sharks crowd aint too bad.

Beers on tap are good.  Smithwick's (pronounced  'smith-icks') is one of my favs and they usually have the seasonal Sam Adams too.  Good selection of Scotch if thats your mood.

A few years ago on my birthday, the owner got the bar to sing and gave me a free shot.  I've seen that a few times since...its kind of cool.

St. Patty's is always fun here too, they open up the back and upstairs.  Its worth checking out if you don't have any plans.",10/9/2008,Chris R.,5,0,0,0,43
"I hate to say this....I gave this place 5 stars. Why? It was the first place I went to when I was trying to get over my exboyfriend years ago. My cousin Aja H. took me here in account to trying to make me feel better. She did...until the minute I puked. Now I look back on this place and I smile about it. Plus, the last time I came in here was with my two good friends and my boyfriend at the time. We wanted to use the restroom, but we weren't allowed to use it unless one of us got a drink. Turns out...one of my girlfriend's downs a large glass of beer with my boyfriend. Crazy night! We went club hoppin' and ended the night at this place. Thanks O'Flaherty's for your bathroom use and the times I got drunk and puked in front of your place. Hehe! Many thanks to the guys for their homage...words of wisdom in regards to exboyfriends and how much of an asshole they are.

I've turned a cold shoulder.  

And yes, after all of those lonely nights together, I am only giving you three stars because you were good to me at a time when I was desperate.  A time when places that were confused of their status, is it a dive-is it an urban hip club, were ok to hang at.  Unfortunately, old friend, that time has come to pass.

"So first off before I tell the tale of this place, yes I did like it, yes I did have a good time and the day I went, yes, it was Mardi Gras.

So after walking around with friends around downtown SJ for Mardi Gras, being hollared at, not being able to get through to any place due to the streets being blocked off, finally we found this place.

Its an Irish Pub, a lot like any other ones here in the bay area I've gone to, complete with wood walls, thick wooden bar, smokers outside, people who drink alot, guiness signs and tough but fun looking bartenders.  The prices were normal, the place was pretty clean, the selection was pretty good for beer and liqour.  I got a little bit of attitude from the bartender for asking for a drink he didn't know of but everyone else was great.

So the craziness you ask?  The bouncer hit of me by asking me ""If I come there often?""  (seriously)  I saw a little skinny guy try and take on this big dude, twice . . . . . and a girl who was walking in front of me to the bathroom seriously turned her head to side, puked and walked on liked nothing happened, I almost hurled right then and there.

"This is our before and after meeting place when attending anything at the Shark tank (Sharks, Stealth, etc.).  What I really like about O'Flaherty's are the friendly staff (and patrons too) and the authentic feeling of an Irish pub...the owners are from Galway (west side of Ireland).  From the Gaelic street signs that hang from the posts between the seating area and the bar, to the black and white photos of old Ireland and its inhabitants, this bar is wonderful.  The dark mahogany bar and tables may make it seem dark and dreary to some, but this is reflective of a typical Irish watering hole. The people (oh, and the Guinness) are who/what make it cheery!  Oh those Irish accents.  

We don't usually go there for food, but I have seen chicken wings and other munchies come out regularly.  I understand that it is service from the restaurant next door...nice arrangement!  Go have a black and tan, or Guinness straight up, and appreciate the shamrock carved in the thick, creamy head.

The decor is standard pub - dark and not all that comfortable, but the ale is flowing and the small selection of food items are pretty darn tasty for a venue like this.

So if you need an evening out and you're looking for some Strongbow or Harp - this is the place!
