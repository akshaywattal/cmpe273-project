    "excerpt":"Came across this great little Irish pub recently while looking for a place to kick back after an evening of dinner and comedy at the local Improv. O'Flaherty's is a laid back pub in the classic sense, and recently voted \"Best Authentic Irish Pub\" by San Jose Magazine. It has a relaxed and authentic feel  -- only nestled downtown in the restaurant district of San Jose. Good selection of beers on tap - emphasis on Irish ales/stouts of course. Food selections although limited, looked good - however didn't get to try since kitchen cutoff is 9:00. Hours? \"...open late [all week]\" :-)",

What I really like about O'Flaherty's are the friendly staff (and patrons too) and the authentic feeling of an Irish pub...the owners are from Galway (west side of Ireland).  From the Gaelic street signs that hang from the posts between the seating area and the bar, to the black and white photos of old Ireland and its inhabitants, this bar is wonderful.  The dark mahogany bar and tables may make it seem dark and dreary to some, but this is reflective of a typical Irish watering hole. The people (oh, and the Guinness) are who/what make it cheery!  Oh those Irish accents.  \n\nWe don't usually go there for food, but I have seen chicken wings and other munchies come out regularly.  I understand that it is service from the restaurant next door...nice arrangement!  Go have a black and tan, or Guinness straight up, and appreciate the shamrock carved in the thick, creamy head.  \n\nOh, and there's Free Parking at the San Pedro garage on weekends...Enjoy!",

The prices were normal, the place was pretty clean, the selection was pretty good for beer and liqour.  I got a little bit of attitude from the bartender for asking for a drink he didn't know of but everyone else was great.\n\nSo the craziness you ask?  The bouncer hit of me by asking me \"If I come there often?\"  (seriously)  I saw a little skinny guy try and take on this big dude, twice . . . . . and a girl who was walking in front of me to the bathroom seriously turned her head to side, puked and walked on liked nothing happened, I almost hurled right then and there.\n\nBut it made for a crazy night and that's all I can ask from an Irish pub.",

    "excerpt":"Ok, so my review of Kell's in Seattle took all of my Irish Pub review thunder........so to set the scene: \n\nI hate bars in Downtown San Jose.........ever since my beloved Good Fellas changed owners (miss you Joey) my man and I were in a state of inebriation depression. Then we went to O'Flaherty's and we had found happiness once again. \n\nBack to why I hate bars in downtown....I hate the downtown crowd. When I was in college it was great but not now. I cant deal with the drunk nimrods and attitudes - people you are in San Jose!!! There is something about men 21-26 yrs old in a dance club that brings out the stupid in them....anyhow thats another thread in itself.....\n\nSo, O'Flaherty's is my happy place. A little outside seating, good beers on tap, a nice selection of liquor, decent pub food, and super nice staff. Did I mention the live Irish music, I love that.....like going to Ireland -only $1,000.00 cheaper....someone get me a Black and Tan",

    "excerpt":"This establishment got star #4 strictly for the live Irish music last Tuesday. Very nice. Very unexpected. I guess I should pay more attention to these things.\n\nI've come here a few times in the past to fulfill French fry/beer cravings and have yet to be disappointed. Granted, I wouldn't dare venture out in downtown on a Friday or Saturday. I'm sure it's packed to the brim just like everywhere else those nights. Any other time, however, it is quite a pleasant place to be. The decor is fitting to the theme, (unlike \"Dive bar\") and always seems to have a seat exactly where you want it. If you go, check out the barrel tables. \n\nAnyways, on to the heart of the matter. French fries. Skinny and crispy. Just like I like em. Salt, pepper, malt vinegar, hot sauce, ketchup, and mustard are all brought to you in a Guinness 6-pack holder. Cute.\n\nThe beer selection on tap is good. Guinness and Boddington's are usually my preferred selections, but theres something for everyone. 5 dollars a pint. I'll usually only have one or two with my fries. They have a happy hour which I will attempt to take advantage of soon. I'll never feel completely comfortable at this establishment until I get good and plastered at least once there.\n\nThe food menu is relatively authentic, and refreshingly simple. Fish and chips, Guinness stew and shepard's pie topped with mashed potatoes to name a few. I'm not a meat eater so I can't say for sure, but the folks dining near my table seemed to enjoy it.\n\nThe crowd that frequents this place during the week seem much more mature than the romper room gangsters that seem to infest every other watering hole in the area. Definitely a plus. Also, background noise is minimal, and conversations are possible. Definitely a rare find for downtown San Jose.",

    "excerpt":"I'd like to start out by saying that I hate downtown San Jose bars. I hate the drunken frat kids doing shots of Jack like its going out of style followed by the slamming of the Budwiesers then yelling at each other at the top of they're lungs. I hate the rail thin chick smelling the ceiling like shes the queen of the bar. I hate the guy thats too cool for the room, like his perfect teeth can cure cancer. To me a good bar is filled with a good staff, good people, and good beer...tada! I started going to O'Smithwicks (as i like to call it) back in 2006 as a good friend of mine began working there. I was hesitant to go there seeing as it lies right around the bend from some places with rather unruly crowds but I was pleasantly surprised to find that is has character of its own. The beer is mid-priced and the shots aren't too bad but the staff is very helpful and they have a great selection of liquor and brews on tap and they have SMITHWICKS! If you've never had it i highly recommend it! O'Flahertys resides in an area with lots of knuckleheads but its almost as if they know they're not invited and they steer clear of it, that I like. The crowd is usually filled with laid back people that range from businessmen to busboys, geeks to freaks, but everyone gets along just fine. If your in San Pedro Square with a taste for the suds but don't feel like dealing with a bunch of  meat heads and skeezers drop in O'Flahertys and say \"give me a Smithwicks!\".",

    "excerpt":"UPDATE......They just lost a star because the last time we went here they had the WORST cocktail waitress ever.  She was a BITCH plain and simple.  She started off the night by telling our party that she didn't like serving or dealing with drunk people...LOL Ummmm let me say this slowly so she will understand...... YOU WORK IN A BAR DUMBSHIT!!  OK so she's a stupid bitch, I can forgive that but she was rude I mean flat out rude!  \n\nWe ended the night with a tab totaling $130 that was brought to us about 35 minutes before last call.  The service was not worth tipping for but I figured when we were done we would give her a small tip in cash.  This chick had the nerve to come back after I signed the tab and point out that I hadn't tipped her!!  Then stopped my bf on his way back from the restroom to ask why she hadn't been tipped.  SERIOUSLY that bitch had nerve.  He told her to take it up with me which of course she was smart enough not to do because by this time I had enough of her bullshit.  I didn't think she could be more ballsy.....WRONG!!\n\nWhen we were getting ready to leave one of our friends handed her $10.....she actually told him that wasn't enough because it wasn't even 10% of our bill.  \n\nSo this wont stop us from going back but if she is there again she'd better not come to our table or I might be spending the night in jail.\n\nThis has become our favorite pub in SJ.\n\nSo with both of us being Irish the pub theme is a winner right away....but there are a lot of ways to screw the pooch on that!!  And thankfully they haven't!!  We love the relaxed style and the great drinks.  \n\nThe staff for the most part is great...The only downside is the Napoleon manager that has AWFUL taste in music.  Aw yes the music is the reason for the 4 stars versus 5.  You should NEVER hear Justin Queerlake playing in an Irish Pub NEVER!!  That and on occasion it tilts kinda yuppie (YUCK!)  \n\nThose minor issues are not enough to keep us from enjoying it and coming back.

I've seen that a few times since...its kind of cool.\n\nSt. Patty's is always fun here too, they open up the back and upstairs.  Its worth checking out if you don't have any plans.",

Bartenders are pretty chill but very busy.  I only drank a glass of beer here and some other mixed drinks.  This is a place mostly for beer drinkers!  \n\nEverytime i pass by that place though, I always get random people trying to get me to come in and join them to get a drink..not the workers there, but people who are sitting/chilling/drinking that ask me... how weird.. maybe i should take up on free drinks offer next time?

The atmosphere is cool, the beer is good and it's close to the HP which makes it an awesome place cool place to head to after a Shark's game. Now here comes the \"but\": The one (and only) thing I find troubling about this place is the smell. I'm serious, it really smells sometimes. I have been here 3 or 4 times now..the first time we were there it was a hot summer day and it was filled with lots of sweaty people and a band who looked like they maybe hadn't showered in days. The stench was pretty bad then, so we opted for a little table under the awning outside. We left, happy and with bellies full of yummy food and beer, planning to head back when it wasn't so crammed with people trying to beat the heat so we could sit inside and enjoy the atmosphere that brought us there in the first place. The second (and third) time we went back it still stunk! What the heck!? I don't get it.....it's a mystery to me. Honestly, the last time we went there, a couple weekends ago, the smell was so bad, especially in the hall on the way to the bathroom that my friend became ill and she left. Thankfully, my sense of smell isn't connected to such a severe gag reflex or else I would miss out on a cool place. I will continue to suck it up (not literally, of course), and keep going back here if I'm in downtown SJ, but I wouldn't mind it if the mystery stench was demystified and taken care of . Peeeee Yewww!\n\nOur waitress was bomb tho :) Especially on a busy Friday night. She did a great job dealing with a bunch of thirsty Sharks fans!",

At first glance, it seems so similar to Firehouse just a few doors down, but inside, the much quieter (though still pretty loud) atmosphere, the dark drinks they have on tap, and the very cool tables and chairs tell me this place is special.\n\nWith the group I met here, everyone was ordering little side dishes and small meals, and the food quality wasn't overwhelming, but if I was hungry enough and the price was low enough, I'd eat here.  After a pint or two, I couldn't tell good food from bad anyway, so I'm probably not one to judge a pub.\n\nSince this place is just across the street from the San Pedro parking lot, and since there's plenty of seating and wide open spaces, I could easily picture myself coming here time and again.\n\nI may have no Irish blood, but you can bet I'll be back again.\n\nPs.

But there isn't a much to do but drink here. But hey, it's an Irish pub, so I guess that fits the bill.\n\nUnfortunately, for an Irish pub, O'Flaherty's does not seem to care that much for St. Patrick's Day. I came here on Monday night with some soccer teammates hoping to to have an Irish Car Bomb are two, chat about the game, and of course, bring in St. Patrick's Day early.\n\nUpon arrival at 12:10 A.M., the bartender rings a bell. I assume he just got a huge tip or something. But the bell was actually for \"last call.\" That is pretty damn early for a local watering hole.\n\nIt was not that slow for such a small place. They still had 10 or 11 people at the bar and I had a small group of 3 with me. That's basically turning business way. But hey, it was Monday and maybe they were prepping for a long day tomorrow. Fair enough.\n\nYesterday, which was St. Patrick's Day, after a super sober experience at Boswell's, I head over here from Cambell and I see a good crowd and proceed to walk inside. I am excited.\n\nI am ready to consume my first St. Patrick's Day drink. As soon as I walk in around 12:15 A.M. and the bell goes off. The bartender called last call at 12:15 A.M. on St. Patrick's Day? Really?\n\nDoes the owner of this bar not care about St. Patrick's Day (even though this is an Irish Pub)? Or maybe he could care less about his customers? Or maybe he doesn't care about money (even though it's green)?\n\nWhatever the reason, this place does not deserve to be called an Irish pub.

They also have a very good draft beer selection.\n\nThere are 2 reasons to go to this bar. It's a great spot to grab after work beer or two with co-workers.

It was nice out and I like their patio on the sidewalk. I've never really been in an Irish pub before but it's definitely different and it's not bad at all. It gives off that cozy vibe and it's nicely decorated. The bartender was nice, although it feels like if you're not the one they helped, they don't really acknowledge you. I'm not really bothered by that since it does happen at other places as well. I ordered a 'Long Island' and it wasn't as strong tasting as most places (that's a good thing) but it did get me a little buzzed. Yes, I'm a lightweight when it comes to drinking lol. They give you a bowl full of pretzels and salted peanuts. They have the popular beers on tap. There's plenty of tables for you to sit down at and hang out. You can actually have a conversation with the person next to you since the music isn't blaring in the background. It's a chill place and I wouldn't mind coming back.",

A very large group of friends and i frequent this pub most friday nights - patty has become a good friend to talk to each time we go, and remembers each one of us by name - she's even remembered our drinks & how we like 'em - to the T! She's a crack up and super friendly. we all love coming to the pub to see our girl patty :) not to mention, that while it's hockey season, the shark tank is super close and wearing your jerseys makes you part of the family instantly :)\n\nalso, the bathrooms are joined with peggy sue's right next door, so if you want, you can have your garlic fries & burger delivered right to you in the pub! or you can just walk over there - sweet set up! :)\n\nthe only downfall is this place is a little small and it's sometimes hard to get a table...luckily patty always gets us one somehow!!! :} so many good drunken memories at this place! & more are sure to come!",

That's the kind of atmosphere this pub has; everyone is friendly and fun.\n\nOn my second trip, I tried the burger. It was good. Nothing to cry from the mountains about, but it was filling. I also met the owner on this trip and said hi to the day manager, who I had met before. They aren't kidding when they say that you are only a stranger here once. Good food, good beer, and good conversation always make for a lovely night.\n\nI have only one issue, and that's the flower people who constantly come in selling flowers. Um, this is a pub.

Like twenty minutes later, the bartender came by and told us he'd knock the price down when he found out we were there for the viewing party. \n\nWe also tried the garlic fries. I appreciated that they weren't your standard \"let's dump minced garlic on fries\" variety. It's not that I don't like those garlic fries, it's just that these were better than usual and it felt like they did something more to them...or maybe I just had too much beer?

She seemed to get pretty irritated one time when we were walking up to the bar to order our drinks since we figured that would be quicker.  \n\nAnyway, this place is great for a drink.  Full bar or plenty of beers on tap.  The food is just ok.  Note they share the kitchen with the burger place next door.  So most of the food isn't very Irish in case you were looking for that.  Mostly fried bar food, burgers, fries, etc.  \n\nBest part for me was showing up on a Sunday afternoon - they do live Irish music (I think also on Tuesday nights).  Basically a bunch of people from the community come there to play.  They all sit around and just jam.  Drinking a pint of Guinness, listening to traditional Irish folk music, chilling at one of their tables outside - it doesn't get much better than this.",

    "excerpt":"First and most important they have a great pint of Guinness. If you have tried Guinness someplace else (or worse, from a bottle or can) and not liked it, try a pint here. It might change your mind. I do not know why, though I have heard many theories, but the quality of Guinness varies tremendously from pub to pub and is sometimes virtually undrinkable. This is one of the best.\n\nI approach this place from a little different perspective because I only go on the occasional Sunday that I am not working and I go to play at the Irish session. My first time I was a bit nervous as every session is different in its acceptance of outsiders, particularly bodhran players. Believe it or not, we drummers are not universally admired and adored. I did not feel any better when I saw there were two other bodhran players there. The rule is only one bodhran player can play at a time and if the incumbents wanted to lock me out it would have been a long wasted trip. I need not have worried. Everyone was welcoming and we drummers examined and played each others' bodhrans. Better yet, one of the other bodhran players played a couple of other instruments so it was just the two of us. Having to sit out every other set of tunes was not a bad thing as it gave me a chance to chat with people. Ray O'Flaherty and his wife came and chatted with me and made me feel even more at home. Then when the time came to leave I asked for my tab and the waitress looked at me as if I were crazy and said musicians are comped. That did not break my heart at all so, aside from a nice tip for the server I paid nothing. \n\nThe thing is my experience is really a reflection of the place as anyone would experience it. A lot of Irish pubs are as Irish as corned beef and cabbage (which is not Irish at all) but this is the real thing.",

I know my volume because I'm currently an Chemical Engineer at NASA-ARC and I know my volumes and factoring in ice displacement. I know no way in hell was that 7-8floz. Poorly made as well. As I was getting ready to pay up the tip she rudely asked if there was a problem as if she was picking a fight with me, and then i said no, why? She demanded her tip. I gave her two dollars which is damn generous for jackassary and poor bartending skills.  The reason why I went along with it was because I was there with my friends and did not want to upset the mood. It's not the establishment's fault. People do make errors in hiring people. But yes, please avoid this bartender. The rest of the staffs were kind and best represented the pub. Please divert your attention to them. \n\nAlso, her carbomb sucked. Using flat beer? Really? Where's your passion missy? \n\nIf this place gave a damn about their drinks like Sabor, man oh man....mad props. \n\nLet's hope this establishment gives her additional training in customer service and bartending.

I was dying to find a good one in our new hood- San Jose. \n\nSo, I had researched and based on yelp found O'Flaherty's... we wanted to host our \"rehearsal\" party... which was more like a drunk party the night before our wedding reception party. I called up the owner who was soooo nice and accomodated to reserve some tables for our party. He didnt request any deposit or anything. Took down my information. \n\nUpon arriving, as promised, there were tables sectioned off for our group. It is a typical Irish Bar set up and I felt a home. I got there early to make sure everything was set right and to await people to come. At that time, I was 2 months pregnant and didnt want everyone to know during the time of our reception(ahem, we got married people two months before this night.. so ya, no shotgun preg, people)... anyways, back to the Irish Pub....I told the waitress of my \"condition\" and she ws sooo cute, she understood that people didnt know and offered to pour me lil shot glasses of water to not make it obvious! ... She just touched my heart right, there, I tell ya...\n\nSo the drinks, drinks, drinks... AWESOME! okay, i didnt have any, thought i was dying for a guiness... but judging from how drunk my best friend got and the verbal vomits she threw up that night, O'Flaherty's did their job right. Our friends loved the drinks and food and everyone had a good time. This will be a regular spot for us... post baby drinking place for me. ;)\n\nQuick note: they do close their kitches at 10 pm... so plan accordingly. Happy Pubbin!",

I had to squeeze in between giant boobies, big bellies, protruding booties, raised armpits carrying beer glasses, and so on and so forth. I totally learned how to duck and hide. Whew! Then I had to remind myself that my fianc was right behind me. So I had to stop and find him. Teehee.\n\nWe went straight to the bar and waited for the bartender to notice me. I was waving my hand with the number four sign. He easily spotted me and gave us our Guinness Stout. Yeah, we got four glasses of Guinness Stout at once because there were tons of people waiting for beer. \n\nWe tried locating our friends and it was so difficult to find them. When we finally located them, they were just outside the back exit near the stairs standing. No tables available. Obviously, we couldn't order any food to eat and we all just got out from work and drinking beer. Bad! Which was why we all had to transfer to the nearby Firehouse Bar and Grill. \n\nI seriously believed that this place was over their maximum capacity last St. Patrick's Day but everybody was just coming and going, and looked like nobody was checking count. Everybody's having a good time I guess. \n\nI would totally give this place three stars because it was really an okay place. I haven't tried their menu and only tried their Guinness. I mean, business is booming when there's a whole lot of patrons. \n\nI just had one issue that I am presently trying to investigate. I was told that four glasses of Guinness Stout was $24.00 and I signed a $2 tip, that's $26.00 in my book. My pending bank card transaction showed me $27.60. What the frack was the extra $1.60 for?\n\nI guess I will be waiting for my bank to finalize the transaction and dispute it. But then, probably all of you would say, \"It's only $1.60.\" Dude, I don't manufacture money here. A penny is worth millions. And without knowing why it was charged on my card made it worst. If it was a swipe charge, why the hell did't they inform me or post a big sign board about it? \n\nHowever, I'm also seriously thinking of not disputing the $1.60. That would only mean, I'll just give them a one star review instead of three because of it and won't go back to this place ever. I'll just be at Firehouse instead.\n\nI'll probably do the latter. \n\nTheir business is worth $1.60 to me.",

Probably your d-bag naughty by nature shining through with dull silverware brilliance. \n\nHe looked at my ID and commented on it AND my super cute date, saying \"Whats up with this guy\". WTF!?

That part was nice.\n\nHe came back and said, \"Did you guys want anything else?\" We shook our head and he held out his hand.\n\n\"$12.\" He said with his hand held out.

We felt pressured and he kept his stare on us with his hand held out.\n\nWe left and yes, never going to return. \n\nNot sure whats up there... he can practice being a bartender on someone else.",

Crazy, it's in the middle of downtown, an oasis.\n\nFull bar. We both started with a Guiness and ate Shepard's Pie and pasties to ward off intoxication from the mixed drinks that followed. \n\nAmbiance? Try foot tapping or stomping Irish/Celtic/Gaelic live music... \nThe players were not 3 feet from us, and my thought was they should be on a stage but I'm really glad they weren't. It brought them and their presence closer. \n\nHours later, happy happy and satiated, we called a cab and  tumbled out to a very happy rest of the evening... \n\nNeedless to say, the next morning was hung-over-city....",

We loved this place for its atmosphere and service, but sadly, those things are no more.\n\nThis is a true shame.  There aren't many places in San Jose that allowed my girlfriend and I to eat food, drink beer, listen to music, and allow us to bring our dog.  Tragic.\n\nI won't be coming back here unless things change.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nOriginal review (4-stars): I came here on a Sunday evening with my girlfriend and our puppy, and I must say that we had a great time.  There was a small Irish band playing some sweet tunes inside the pub; the service was friendly and timely; the food was good and the beer was delicious.  \n\nI'm definitely going to try to get into the habit of coming here more often on Sunday.

The seating can be a little uncomfortable at times because they are old fashioned chairs, but it's not that big of a deal. It gets a little busy on weekend nights and it can be hard to find a table, but it's nice to just come in for a bit and get a beer or two at the bar. I'm not sure if they still do it, but they used to have authentic Irish music on tuesday and sunday nights I think, and that was awesome. The band would just sit in a corner of the pub and play really cool sounding tunes. All in all, it is a great place to go on a Friday night, or just to have a couple beers after work",

Irish - Car - Bomb.\n\nIrish Car Bomb's are 'the bomb' if you WANT to get BOMBED out of your SKULL!!!!!!\n\nHubby and I have been coming here for YEARS (our FAVORITE PUB) and never heard of this drink ... till TUESDAY, that is!!!  \nI asked our lovely waitress for something \"different\" (boy, I really NEED to go to Singlebarrel, LOL!) and she suggested the Irish Car Bomb.  We ordered one for each, and a Smithwick's  (God Bless the Irish!!) chaser.\n\nYes, a pint as a chaser ... YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT????\n\nWe get the drinks-a shot glass filled with half Jameson's and half Bailey's PLUS half a pint of Guiness.  You drop the shot in the Guiness and chug a lug.  Sounds totally gross, but it tastes like whipped chocolate mousse ... SERIOUSLY!!!!!!  So good, I ordered another one ... BEFORE I drank my Smitty's.  BIG MISTAKE!!!\nOr, maybe not, if you are the type who doesn't like to remember dinner ... hmmmm.\n\nSeriously, this place is FANTASTIC!!!  \n\nTheir Black and Tans are made with Guiness and Smithwick's.

    "excerpt":"The only thing saving this from being one-star is the great variety of whiskeys they have. I had plenty of time to study all of them, because it took me a whopping thirty minutes before any of the bartenders took my order. I came in early for trivia night, before it was really crowded. I was standing in plain sight, and even when I moved up flush against the bar and pointedly tried to make eye contact or flag someone over, I was ignored. Only when my friends came in did someone finally come over.\n\nHe took our orders, and then promptly forgot them. He gave everyone else their drinks, and then got sidetracked and abandoned me. The other bartender on duty said \"sorry, it'll be a couple more minutes because a lot of people just came in\". Okay, so they JUST came in. They weren't waiting thirty minutes already. And they came in AFTER I had already ordered. They were clearly friends of the bartenders, as they hung around the laptop (for trivia?) and slightly behind the bar. They got all of their drinks before mine was finally finished. 45 minutes total.\n\nWhen they finally did give me my Rob Roy, it and the Irish Apple I got for a friend were both half the usual size, for slightly more than the usual price.\n\nThe trivia is not worth all the trouble. It's not as fun and multimedia as Dive Bar's, and the hostess goes on and on about inconsequential things. I know that every place has that \"quiz master is always right!\" rule, but usually when they're blatantly wrong, they admit it and concede the point. When the quiz master here mixed up the Pantheon and the Parthenon, despite a very loud outcry from an overwhelming majority, she rudely bitched \"if you don't like it, you can leave\". So we did. And I probably won't ever willingly come back.",

They also ran a 15 dollar minimum charge on credit cards (which they neglected to mention when I called to ask if they took credit), and were selling beers for 7 bucks a pop, meaning you had to keep your tab open for at least three beers. It was also more crowded than a Columbian brothel.\n\nI'd like to go back again on a non-holiday, just to see how everything is without the insanity of a good 120 patrons more than the fire marshal suggests.

You never have to worry about it being too stuffy or the air circulation being bad. Even on the MOST crowded nights (St. Patty's Day), the pub does not get too stuffy because there is no wall that separates the patio from the inside.\n\nI've been to O'Flaherty's during the day when it is COMPLETELY empty, and during St. Patty's Day when it is COMPLETELY filled, and I must say, I've enjoyed both experiences a lot!

And one of them can sing just like Amy Lee :)\n\nMy last little complaint is in regards to the high percentage of creepers who seem to hang out here. Maybe there should be a bouncer stationed at the door with someone there to give a brief psychological evaluation before entry is permitted, because, for whatever reason this place seems to attract men who are a little off.\n\nI've had several weird experiences with creepy dudes, but last night I was mildy entertained when some stranger first tried to rub my shoulders and then stroke my hair, despite my protests - entertained, only because it gave me the opportunity to tell him off, and, better yet, watch my big (ex-military) sister cuss him out for me.",

    "excerpt":"Real chill. I like the Irish pub look, feel and brews.\n\nI came here on St. Patrick's Day and although they had a $10 cover charge, I had a blast. I don't know if the back patio is normally open, but on this specific day it was (which made sense). They had a mini bar set up and a fast delivery bartender. The heat lamps, tables and porter pottys were super necessary and gave me and my friends a comfortable place to chill. There was a TON of people celebrating the Irish holiday so they also opened up the second floor and the bar upstairs. The 2nd floor you ask? Yes, I was equally surprised. There's a stage and full bar up there! I don't know if it's part of O'Flarhery's or another venue, but it's super dope. There's a dance floor by the stage and the stage is low so it feels intimate. On St. Patty's, they hired a U2 cover band! I had a jolly good time that night and because of that I've dropped in every time I'm at San Pedro Square.\n\nPint of Guiness for me, please.",

If you have never experienced this place after a sharks game, especially a win, than make sure to go there after one of the games even if you don't go.

This place seemed to fit the bill nicely.\n\nWe went on a Wed. afternoon for a pint or two and some lunch.  When we walked in, there were a few people sitting at the bar, but no bartender, no server or hostess, and no sign indicating to seat ourselves or order at the bar.  After several minutes, the bartender finally came out and took our order.  I let him know that we wanted to eat, so he gave us the menu card.   After taking our drink order, we watched as the bartender went behind the bar and changed his shirt.  Not cool...\n\nThe menu had very few choices, it was literally a card.  I had the cheeseburger and she had a Caesar salad.  Food came out in decent time, but was marginal quality at best.  My cheeseburger was was too greasy, and her salad looked like it came straight out of a bag from the Safeway produce aisle.  \n\nOn the bright side, and what got this place two stars instead of 0 or 1, they had a great beer selection.  I had a Murphy's and an IPA (cant remember the name, but really good), and she had a patron margarita.  \n\nAfter we left, we decided that we're not going to give this place another chance the next time we're in town.  The prices were a little high for what we got ($50.00 for two beers a maragrita, salad and a burger), the service was bad (we felt like we were imposing on the bartender/server when we made our order) and the food wasn't great.  I hate to give bad reviews, and I'm glad that some people seem to like it...I really wanted to like the place as the atmosphere and decor seemed really cool, but I think we'll try something else next time",

The waitresses have always been friendly, and my drinks good. Garlic fries are delicious. I always recommended this place to friends for an easy-going night.\n\nMy low rating is for the blatant disregard of smoking laws and their \"so what\" attitude when asked very politely to fix it.\n\nO'Flaherty's front walls sort of roll up so there's no separation between the inside and outside. It's a really neat feature, unless there's a lot of smokers on the patio, which on trivia night, there is. Now, I'm fine with people wanting to smoke, and I even overlook that they're right up against the front of the bar, right next to the doors and the usually open doors or rolling wall. I don't expect people who are smoking to go stand in the middle of the street (or however far 20ft is). But, you'd think that the staff would realize that most people don't want to smell the cigarette smoke and keep the rolling walls and doors (when people aren't walking through them of course) closed.\n\nWhen it first started to become a problem, I talked to a few of the waitresses and I was told the higher-ups wanted to keep the doors and walls open. OK, I sucked it up for another few months until it was really bad one night. I got up to close the door that I wasn't even sitting near, but once I had closed it, one of the bartenders opened the door up again. The thing is, it doesn't seem to be about getting air circulation, since there are ceiling fans that are never on.\n\nI wrote to O'Flaherty's via their website, and got no response. I lodged a complaint with the county, but was told others had complained and the city of San Jose's Code Enforcement wasn't doing anything. The guy from the county said O'Flaherty's probably wouldn't do anything until they get \"sued, fined or closed\" (his words, not mine). I called San Jose's code enforcement, and got no response from them either. I'm really sort of disappointed that O'Flaherty's would ignore requests to shut doors to stem cigarette smoke. I didn't curse, I didn't scream. I wrote letter just like this one. I talked to numerous people about the problem before I made a formal complaint. I didn't have to go that far, but I did because I felt I wasn't being taken seriously by the staff. Apparently I wasn't the only one pushed to that extreme by this bar.",

    "excerpt":"I decided to venture to San Jose to check out the Annie Leibovitz exhibit at the San Jose Museum of Art.  When I've told people this, they're like, \"You went ALL THE WAY to San Jose?!\"  Relax, it's 30-45 minutes away.  \n\nI parked on Santa Clara Street because (1) I noticed Los Gatos Brewing Company, (2) I love breweries, and (3) it's a hop, skip and a jump away from the San Jose Museum of Art.  Sadly, it's closed on Saturdays (um, all of Saturday = prime beer drinking hours, LGBC).  I noticed a sign for a wine bar \"without the pretension\" so I followed it.  Naturally, I like to have a drink before looking at art as it gets those creative synapses firing.  \n\nBefore I could find any wine bar I noticed O'Flaherty's (referred to as OFIP in the rest of this review) and quickly changed plans.  The storefront of OFIP is completely open.  This was a welcome change from the 59-degree-in-July weather on the peninsula (which I enjoy 90% of the time), at least for the afternoon.  I always forget that San Jose enjoys 80 degree temperatures in the summer.  \n\nI walked in and looked at the chalkboard for about 5 minutes.  As a bona fide beer-nerd, I must say that their offerings were as extensive as they were impressive. I had just finished reading the chalkboard menu when I noticed another one off to my left.  What?!  I was kind of overwhelmed by the choices--I didn't want to make a bad one.  The bartender walked out from behind the bar and asked if I needed help.  Did I ever!  I asked if he had Pliny the Elder, to simplify things for myself since I know I love that beer.  They didn't have it (shucks).  I asked him for an IPA recommendation.  He suggested the Santa Clara IPA.\n\nAt an Irish bar with such a big import selection, I felt kind of lame ordering a local beer, but what the heck.  When in Santa Clara County, do as the Santa Claras do.  (Just kidding, I actually don't know if San Jose is in Santa Clara County.)  It was a solid beer--strangely smooth, rich caramel color, not too dry or hoppy.  Actually, that doesn't really sound like an IPA now does it?  Normally they are dry, bitter, fragrant--biting even.  Hm.  No matter--I'm generally happy with a beer in tow.  \n\nI sat on the sidewalk patio to enjoy my brew in the sunshine.  The bartender even delivered the beer to me versus making me wait at the bar for it.  Ah-the best.  All of a sudden, the car alarm from a blue pick-up truck parked across the street started going off incessantly.  My word--can a girl get a minute's peace?  It would stop for five minutes and then get going again.  Man alive, it was annoying.  A sassy hipster fella walked by and asked the kids 2 tables away from me if he could have a pen and a paper. He proceeded to write a note to the owner of the vehicle.  \"Dear Sir or Madam: I couldn't help but notice your blue truck parked across the street...\" and on and on about how it disturbed his afternoon, but with the politest tone. Haha-nice.\n\nI finished 3/4 of my beer (I never drink the remaining 1/4--always leave that for the homies). I peaced out shortly thereafter.\n\nOFIP has large televisions that you can see from the sidewalk patio with sports ball on (soccer or baseball that day).  It was very full for a Saturday afternoon (Read: day drinking is encouraged).  Unbelievable beer selection.  All in all, A++ environment for hooliganism.  \n\nOne little drawback--my beer was $9.00 (*low whistle*). That was almost twice the cost of my ticket to the museum. Thank you, tech industry!  (Note: If your beer is $9, a good tip is $2 per beer, and not $1 per beer.  Only the best for our friends.)\n\nOther than that, loved it.",

He later monitored the bar from the inside and as I was making my way to the restroom, was kind enough to warn everyone to step aside and make some room for me to walk through.\nIt's a cozy bar with a mini seating area out front. The bar's theme totally slipped my mind that when my friend asked what I wanna drink, I didn't answer with Irish car bomb!\nI was told that they offer karaoke but we didn't stay long enough to find out. Next time",

I may not look like I know much, but bam! years of religiously watching Jeopardy and mentally inhaling Brain Quest as a child finally paid off.\n\nAlso, great bartenders, but drinks are a hit or miss sometimes, so I stick with beer. The crowd here varies depending on the day, but in general, friendly people and interesting characters.\n\nThe bathrooms are in the back and shared with the diner next door.\n\nMy bf loves Scott the bouncer and would give 5 stars to him alone.",

Not every bar I go into knows how to make an Old Fashioned, but they did and they made it well. This isn't really the place to meet people though because it seems like everyone here is in their own little world. They also have live music often, especially during the summer months.",
