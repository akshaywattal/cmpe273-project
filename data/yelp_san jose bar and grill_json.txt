A hot blonde asks \"how can I help you,\" I say \"what are your happy hour specials?\"  She replies \"sorry we don't open until 5pm.\" I ask \"then can I just sit at the bar until you open?\" to which she says \"sorry we're still closed.\" THEN WHY DID YOU ASK HOW YOU CAN HELP ME, and WHY IS THE DOOR OPEN!  Sigh.Once open, the food is hit or miss (tater tots no, chicken pizza yes) and the atmosphere is upbeat for a bar.  Friends say this is the best place to watch bay area sports because it's one of the only places that plays the sound, but it's no big deal for me.  A bar is a bar is a bar, once it's open.....",

The door to the bathroom is always open (I actually do not know if there is a door) and there's only one stall, so it sucks if you have shy bladder. When I went to the bathroom, two guys were talking kinda loud and it seemed like one or both maybe wanted to fight? There was also one of those guys who hands you paper towels and wants money, but there are a lot of sinks and it's hard for him to stand between them and the door so it was pretty easy to avoid him.",

For this visit, we actually came here for happy hour and let me tell you, their happy hour is not that happy. It is actually pretty expensive still.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, the food isn't too bad and the bartenders are pretty nice, but I think they spread their employees a little too thin. They weren't able to greet our table for 20 minutes and it took them even longer for them to get us our beers. We ordered 2 different types of sliders, calamari, and loaded tater tots. We wait for almost an hour in total for all of our food to finally come out.\n\nI would recommend to sit at the bar instead of a table if you are choosing to eat here. I am giving then 2 stars solely for the bartender and server. They were very pleasant and apologetic for having us wait so long for all of our items. It is not their fault that they have been spread too thin and are just physically unable to do everything they are supposed to.",

Hip hop music with a small dance floor and huge bar area.\n\nBut then they had their Gosh Golly Miss Molly night, which blew my mind.\nThey had amazing lights, great EDM music, and handed out glow sticks. We bounced to LOFT after that, and kept getting harrassed by people jealous of our big foam glowsticks. We came back to Bar & Grill after, because we liked the atmosphere better. We didn't want the night to end!\n\nOn other nights, they never play EDM. I've special requested it before, and they said the closest they'll play is \"Get Lucky\" by Daft Punk. Whatever...\n\nOne good thing, there's no cover. And they have great drink deals on special nights, like Tuesdays. But their website (and Yelp) is really outdated on hours and such. Someone needs to get on that.\n\nOh, and I left my card there. They were very helpful in locating it in the back. That was great.\n\nWas this review …?",

Even though they serve American bistro style food, it smells like Indian cuisine in here. Weird.  The service was decent. They only serve one brand of red wine so my options were limited but it was decent.  What earns this place four stars is the burger itself. I ordered  a black and bleu burger that actually had some decent spice to it.  There was a hefty serving of bleu cheese crumbles too.  It was really good and it came with cajun fries that were nigh on perfect in terms of flavor and crispiness.  I would eat here regularly if I lived close.",

We usually go on Fridays and came once on a Tuesday before Tiesto. Pretty good service from my experience. The $2 wells aren't that strong sometimes but you can't expect too much for $2, tbh. After a few of these, I'm usually on a good level to enjoy myself. We were here a few Fridays ago and the DJ was on point with the music. I'm talking some top 40 + late 90s + early 00s jams! Not hard to find a spot to touch down with your friends and hang out for the night. Once you get tired of SJBJ, you can easily walk to any of the neighboring bars or lounges.\n\nGood spot to start your night or pre-game before an event.",

True Baydestrians if you ask me, so if you are a Raider, A's fan, Charger fan or any fan other than those red, gold, teal, black, and orange folk, you will be the minority.\n\nTheir house beer which is supposed to be similar to Pabst is ok. Easy drinking beer that ends up being like water after your 2nd pint. But i must say, good job on those sliders and cajun fries, those caught me off guard. They were really tasty, juicy and just plain yummy. The fries were reminiscent of boiling crab cajun fries lol.\n\nBartenders are chill here, the dudes are cool and constantly had my beer refilled since i chose the all you can drink house draft for ufc 152 which i will say had NO COVER.\n\nOverall ok in my book, it's next to everything like Loft, OG and Tres so if you aint feeling the vibe you can always jet next door or across the street",

I was in town (Red Wings fan) for the game on St. Patrick's Day.\n\nThe service was absolutely horrible... Before you just to conclusions and assume that I'm being picky because of the holiday, this was at 5:30 and the bar was only a quarter full when we arrived.\n\nWe sat down at a table and the bartender (a female with brown hair) looked at us and just kept serving drinks to people at the bar and then seemed put out to help us. After waiting for nearly 10 minutes, I walked up to the bar and was finally served a drink.\n\nBeer special of the day: $12 pitcher of PBR... Absolutely ridiculous! The shots were even more.\n\nOnly pro of the whole place was the food. I had the Corned Beef Reuben and my girlfriend had the Club Panini. Both were served very warm and tasted extremely fresh.\n\nAfter all was said and done (still had to keep walking up to the bar for drinks, while other bartenders served other tables around us.)",

Perfect amount of everything. They were $7 each, which I suppose is a pretty average price.\nWe also tried their St. Patrick's Day drink specials- a Lucky Charms ($5) and Shamrock shot ($3). The Shamrock was bomb. The bartender misheard us when we ordered that one and accidentally made an extra. So, he took it off the bill and did that extra shot with us. Loved it, he was fun.\nPlenty of seating. Huge screens and lot of TVs. There was music playing and the Sharks were on. We had a lot of fun, I'm sure we'll be back!",

I've only lived here in SJ for 2 months so maybe I'm wrong. Anyway, it was my first time there last night (Thursday). I went for a friends birthday and we elected to have the 2 for 1 bottle service. At about 10:00pm, they move all the bar tables and high chairs from one end of the bar and carry out leopard print couches, transforming one end into a haphazardly made lounge. On the other end, they clear everything to make a small dance floor. The DJ's music selection was good, but the speakers were waayyy too loud so your conversations consist of yelling at each other. It wasn't too uncomfortably packed. The drinks are priced averagely. There's a food menu and a taco stand right out front. Our waitress was really on point and continually checked on us. The patio area's small, especially for the amount of people that were there. All the smokers looked like a can of packed Sardines out there lol!

    "excerpt":"This is a fun and friendly place.  It has a very good selection of beers on draft and lots of TVs around the bar for watching various sporting events.  It however, is not completely typical of 'sports bars' I've been to.  The crowd is more varied and lively than usual for a sports bar.  It is a nice place to hang out with friends.   The menu is limited, consisting mostly of appetizers, burgers, salads and paninis.  The burgers are good.  The wings are outstanding;  two to three times as large and meaty as the typical wings/drummies.  They come out hot and crispy and are available in several flavors.  To their detriment, they don't have a typical 'buffalo-type' sauce, and their 'hot' variety lack any particular flavor besides being just hot and vinegary.  The sweet chili in combination with the hot however?  Outstanding!    They also have tater tots!  They say that they are as good as Mom used to make, but they are better, because Mom didn't deep fry them.  The tots are however a little too salty, which is saying something because I love salty food.  All in all, this is a pretty nice place to hang out and watch a ball game or to be out with friends.\n\nThe only real criticism I have about the place is that the first time we were here, we ordered wings by themselves, and then about 15 minutes later, ordered burgers.  The wings did not come out until after the burgers, which was not good.  The next time, we waited until the wings came out before ordering the burgers.  But generally speaking when you order appetizers, you should get them first, and the fact that you don't would suggest a somewhat mis-managed kitchen. It would also be nice if they served the wings with celery AND carrots.  So they get a 3 rather than a 4.   Also, note, they don't validate parking, so figure on adding 5-6 bucks to your bill for that, although they are very convenient for transit!",

I got a pint of Blue Moon for a friend and myself, and it was terrible! The beer was flat, lukewarm, and strangely acidic tasting. It tasted like someone opened a bottle of beer, left it in an enclosed hot car and then let it settle to room temperature before slapping a slice of orange in it.\n\nOther than the drink, the DJ was kind of awkward. He couldn't seem to find a song that people could actually dance to.\n\nI may go back on a night when there are more people and the music is a little better.

One of the girls in our group just turned 21 and we decided to grab a quick drink here.  Two of my friends went in before the birthday girl. When she goes up they tell her they can't let her in because it hasn't been 24 hours since her birthday had passed.\n\nOk ok, we understand. We prepare to leave peacefully. So we step aside and try to call and text our friends on the inside.  I ask the bouncer if I can grab them because I can see them from the door. He say ok, I grab them.  When I get back I ask if we can get a refund for them because they were inside for less than 5 minutes.  They didn't drink, they didn't dance.  He says no because he'd need to ask his manager.  So we ask to speak to a manager and he replies \"He won't stop what he's doing to talk to you\".  He says this without asking any of the other bouncers and without getting on his little walkie talkie to even ask if his manager was around.\n\nDear SJBG Manager, I don't know how you treat your customers.  But this is how your bouncers treat people.  I understand they hate their jobs.  I understand they deal with drunk/stupid/mean people all night.

When the Sharks play, the wings are always $.55 cents and their happy hour menu is AWESOME.\n\nI love the combo wings as well as the cajun tater tots. I definitely order both of those when I'm watching a Sharks game downtown. Sometimes if I'm going all out, I'll order the sliders (which come with a side of tots or whatever you want) and then my hubby and I split wings for an appetizer.\n\nAll that greasy goodness + beer + a good game = A REALLY WONDERFUL TIME.\n\nI admit, when there's a playoff game for any sport, this place gets REALLY packed. And when it gets packed, it can be frustrating getting service started. For me, I can see that all the servers are trying really hard to get to everyone so I just make sure I know what I want. I usually get to order within 10 minutes.\n\nThe vibe there is really great though. It's my go-to spot for happy hour on sports game nights and the crowd (especially SJ SHARKS FANS) get really into it and I love it.\n\nIf you just want really awesome service and hate sports, DO NOT go here.\n\nThis place is the kinda place where people who LOVE sports, beer, and greasy fried food love to kick it and cheer on their sports teams :)",

Make sure they're sweet chili, simply divine.  The sweet and spicy sauce will leave you licking your fingers and ordering seconds!\n\nThe biggest issue I have (and reason why they didn't receive 5 stars is the pricing for the specialty drinks/shooters).  I ordered three cherry bombs, thinking the price would be around $7-8 dollars per each.   To my surprise, I received the bill and saw that it was well over $10 for each shooter. Disappointment sank in.\n\nOther than that, I love this place! Once again, the wings are cheap on Sharks game nights - around $2.75 for 4 wings! You absolutely cannot beat that.  On one occasion, my total bill was less than a little more than $25 for 12 wings, a pitcher of beer, a glass of beer, and a well drink.  That's pretty damn hard to beat for a location like this in the heart of downtown San Jose.",

You can actually get some good savings and they don't just have a bunch of stuff you don't like on it.  \n\nYou can't really go wrong with any of the sliders and the fries that go with it, but the hidden treasure is the tator tots you can substitute the fries for.

All the bartenders were pretty chill and would talk to you. We'd always get a few pitchers and some sliders and end up staying the rest of the night.\n\nIf you come here on weekdays, you will still get this kind of atmosphere, but it's like stepping into a completely different place over the weekends.\n\nI think as some of the bigger trendy clubs (Vivid/Pearl, Vault, Sabor) closed, the \"trendy\" people who would visit those clubs started heading to Bar and Grill on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. We used to fit in with some nicer casual clothes (business casual), but now, I wonder if we'd be let in.\n\nIf you get there before 11 (I think?) you don't have to pay a cover charge, but they usually will start to form a line outside after that.\n\nWe usually try to get there around 10 so we can get a table and claim some territory. This place will be packed by 11:30. They have some good video-DJs that play a lot of top-40/hip hop music and keep it up beat. But it's really loud so it's hard to talk without yelling into someone's ear.\n\nIf it gets to hot by the dance floor, you can go back to the front and either try to get a table outside with the smokers or find a spot on their couches.\n\nI've had a lot of great times at this place and made some good friends, but I am sometimes reluctant to go back to SJBG now.",

As explained by the nice and friendly server they have to pay like $35 per TV if they show that fight, and knowing they have lots of TVs it may not be worth it. So I guess that kinda solve the mystery why the other place have to charge $15/person on entrance fee.\n\nFood here was good. Quite a few selection of foods in their menu.

But here is where my bad review comes from this place and why I said to my self and anyone that I know not to go there anymore and so far I have been successful on this, is because one night after a soccer match my friends and I decided to go and celebrate, first we ate some pizza at 4th street and then we went to this place. Wasn't really drinking much, was mainly there to hang out and have an occasional drink with my team mates and enjoy the night. We ware in the small patio area, when I decided to go to the restroom for the second time in a row, when all the sudden, after I had passed the dance floor and was a few feet from the restroom a couple of security guys grabbed my by the arm and kicked me out from the back door. I ask why and all they said is they didn't like me and to get out of the place. I tried to explain and ask then to at least let me grab my jacket that I had inside with my friends, but since I was too close to the back door and didn't event get a chance to finish asking why I was being kicked out or if I could at least get my jacket. Luckily for me my friends were still at the patio and I was able to reach for my stuff and after I explained to them what had happen they decided to ditch the place and never went back there.",

The bar tender, I forget his name, was friendly and we chatted for a bit while I ate and drank.\n\nI'll definitely be back again.\n\nBoth times I had jack and cokes, though they have a full bar.

They were pretty short staffed for a Saturday night in downtown SJ.  2 bartenders working the bar and the tables.  I flagged down the bartender and got him to get us some booze.  I walked over to the front desk and grabbed three menus and brought them back.  When the bartender returned with our drinks, I quickly ordered - figuring I wouldn't see the dude again for a while.  All three of us made it easy on him - three BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger with fries.\n\nThe food actually returned quickly - the burger was pretty pathetic.  Obviously once a frozen disc.  The bacon was thin and measly.  Finally, the fries were skinny little bitches.\n\nOn the plus side, they have like 20-30 beers on tap.  But the food sucks.  They should change the name to San Jose Bar, and eliminate the Grill... stick to drinking and late nights here.",

This can consist of $3 shots to 50 cent Pabst's lol. The happy hour is good too, especially the cheap food.\n\nThe crowd though..not so glamorous! kinda creepy if you wanna say. I seen my fair share of weirdos here but it's downtown so what do you expect. But the crowd pretty much includes people who didn't want to pay cover at Tres or people who couldn't get into Tres! lol\n\nSo why 4 stars?! Like I said, I usually have fun here. There is usually no cover unless you go super late on a Friday/Saturday night. No dress code here, and they have plenty of places to sit and chill if you don't feel like dancing. Usually a group of 4-5 bartenders working, so you don't have to wait too long for drinks.\n\nI don't come here on the weekends, but if I happen to be out during the week and just wanna chill with some friends, Bar and Grill is always one of our first choices!",

Maybe I'm just dreaming, but wouldn't it be great to go to an awesome club/bar where the people who designed it didn't just say, 'Meh, throw in a couple of urinals and a stall, that's good enough.' If money is spent on leather couches, rockin stereo/pa system, good food, lights, the whole nine, then about $100 was spent on the bathroom?-why, not sure but this seems to be the case too often than not.",

I've never been to a karaoke bar before, but from what I can imagine, this environment close to it...minus the tinsel curtains propped on a stage.\n\nEven if you don't plan on singing on the mic, you'll find yourself singing along on some crowd favorites. The $3 kamikazee special on Tuesdays goes well with the karaoke crowd.  \n\nSJBJ has been one my favs in the downtown San Jose area due to its open space around its rectangular bar. I tend to like bars where you can walk around compared to those up against a wall because (1) there's more bartenders, (2) you don't have breathing down your neck trying to get the bartenders attention, (3) more room to mingle!\n\nThe bartenders there are cool! Our group of friends tend to look for the bartender coined \"Dolphin\" for his Orange Julius shooter! (One of my favorite shooters!) Him and another bartender Jake/Jay gets the crowd into it on the karaoke nights serving and singing at the same time. Much props!\n\nSJBJ is one of the few places to have their kitchen open late, so check out them tator tots and fries!\n\nDefinitely a spot I would go to and recommend!",

One night I came here on a Thursday night because all of the other places in downtown SJ had a line or had cover. Another night I came out on a Monady night just because we wanted some junk food and drinks. Both times this place did me well.\n\nThursday night was more of a club feel with the dance floor and club music. It wasn't too crowded since the more popular clubs in SJ had 70% of SJ waiting in their lines. They had drink specials and best of all...there is no cover or dress code. It's a real chill place.\n\nMonday night is more of a bar environment. They also had a DJ that played some pretty damn good music (Lucy Pearl, Lupe Fiasco, etc.). If you come after 10 PM, they have 50 cent chicken wings (which were the best wings I have ever had...then again I don't normally order chicken wings anywhere else), $4 smirnoff drinks, and 50 cent PBRs. They also had beer pong where the dance floor would usually be. Very chill environment. The bartenders were friendly. Again, no cover!\n\nThis place is one you come to just chiiiill til the next episode. If you have expectations, you might be disappointed. Look at the name! Look at the decor! It's not trying to impress you! It's trying to invite you in and have you kick back. No cover, bomb chicken wings, good music, & chill atmosphere gets 4 stars from me!",

And then, like anything good in downtown San Jose, the \"ghetto flu\" took over and it's never been the same.\n\nThis place is located right in \"Crime Alley\" in downtown San Jose. For those who are not a geek like I am, \"Crime Alley\" is where Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered by Joe Chill. This tragic incident would be the driving force to make him Batman.\n\nWell, San Jose Bar & Grill, along with Tres Gringos, Voo Doo, and Toon's are some of the most urban joints in downtown San Jose. The crowds are ridiculously ghetto. They tried making the line longer and adding a cover (gasp!) of $5, but the wannabe thugs and hood rats still show up.\n\nI never come on the weekends anymore. It's too dangerous. You are better off grabbing a quick bite and few drinks for happy hour here.\n\nThe karaoke here on Tuesday nights is pretty bad. I came here the other night and the crowd is very R&B/Rap, which makes for pretty awful karaoke as R&B songs are extremely difficult to sing as they often have layered vocals (and the drunken singers have no idea which part of the song to sing, especially towards the end). Plus, people who do hardcore rap songs just look foolish.\n\nAnyway, most of the people do not care if you are singing. They barely clap for anyone. And the venue proves to not work for karaoke as there is no stage and the lyrics are behind you. Plus, the huge central bar makes it hard for people to see you. I was able to stir up a standing ovation, but then again, I am the King of Karaoke.\n\nWhat else would you expect? People not cheering? Oh, that only happens at the crappiest karaoke venues in Santa Clara county like Bronco's and 7 Bamboo.\n\nAnyway, if the world can make a cure for the \"swine flu,\" then I am fairly sure they can cure the \"ghetto flu\" that is afflicting San Jose Bar & Grill.",

There were mostly women than men there that night. Funny part was that all the guys had there backs against the wall, so It made it awkward when you had to pass them to go to the restroom. You felt like you were walking the runway for them, not that great. Oh yeah the reason why its the best place to go, is because when I showed them my ID, the bartender said you get free drinks, I was like woo hoo lets stay here ladies! anything for free drinks!",

A little more pricey than Cluck U's or The Brit charges for pitchers of beer in downtown.\n\nThey got some hot bartenders and servers over here though.  The dance floor is pretty small in the back.

Definitely not ready to end the night yet. We got to Gordon Biersch at about 9:30pm and had one drink each then left. We were walking around downtown looking for a place that was still open and were actually flagged down by the bar manager.\n\nI haven't been here in a while but from what i remember, the couches that they have are gross and dirty, the music is just alright, and it does tend to attract the ghetto crowd. My encounters with people here weren't always the greatest, and I even remember some guys trying to actually start a fight with me and girlfriends because they wanted a chair from our table when my friend got up to have a smoke. I think my best times here were when there weren't that many people and it was the friend's I had with me that night  which made my time enjoyable.\n\nI think they' were open until 2 that night, and there some rude and abnoxious people. There was a girl hatin in the bathroom... Not everyone is old enough to know the music from your era. And no... it is not chill to holla at the bartenders from across the bar for more drinks...\n\nBut getting past the small mindedness, in the end, we had a pretty good time. The manager and his bartender that night were friendly and talkative. They took us on a tour of great tasting but weak shots and came back often seeing of we were doing alright or if the guys we were talking to were bothering us. Jimmy the bartender, you are awesome. Since there weren't that many people, it was really just a good night to chat and have a drink with my friend marissa.\n\nThere are definitely other places i'd rather go, and i'd only go here if my friends really wanted to.",

I called around 5:30 to ask if  they were charging a cover for that night, and was told that they  were not as long as people were in costume.  I showed up around 11pm and found that they were charging cover. I was not to happy but it was understandable since it was Halloween night.\n\nOnce I got into your bar my friends and I went to get a drink at the front of the bar, the bartender in a ghost busters coveralls, helped the people to the left of us, the people to the right of us, the people behind the people to the right of us, the people behind us, and all the while he would occasionally make eye contact with any one of me or my friends but quickly look away.\n\nFinally, extremely frustrated I walked down the bar and order from another bartender, my friends stayed there and eventually attracted the attention of the bartender across the bar.  Let me be clear in all the time we spend waiting for the bartender in the ghost buster coveralls never helped us! At the same moment I was able to get the bartender down the bar to serve me.\n\nI have to say the experience was one I will never go through ever again!  My roommate warned me that the bar wasn't great and I wish I had listened.  After waiting in line and paying cover, I wasn't interested in leaving since it was already late.  But that one bartender was so awful that I won't go back, in fact the whole experience was disappointing.  Unfortunately, voodoo lounge and tres gringos are tainted by association.",

I told her to make me her favorite mixed drink and she straight up said, \"honey, I only do shots.\"  Yes, Allison doesn't play.  Despite her confession she concocted a mixed drink for me that tasted good.  I asked her what it was and she told me she had no idea and just mixed a bunch of drinks.

Instead, we walked across to Loft and had a night of drinking, dancing and fun DRY conversation.",

    "excerpt":"SJ Bar and Grill can be summed up in 4 words:  piss poor customer service.  The staff is disgruntled and often more wasted than the customers.  Here's the transcript of one of my encounters:\n\nMe:  \"You didn't put any Grey Goose in my Cranberry.\"\nBartender 1:  \"Yes, I did.\"\nMe: \"No, you didn't.  I just watched you make it.\"\nBartender 1 continues to argue with me.\nBartender 2, who is completed sloshed btw, tries to get in the mix: \"I SWEAR I put Grey Goose in there.  You are wrong!\"\nMe:  \"Who are you?!  You didn't even make my drink!  Where did you come from and why are you talking to me?\"\n\"Manager\":  We are not going to remake your drink.\nMe:  I don't want it remade.  I want what I ordered.  I'm not going to pay $10.00 for an Oceanspray Cranberry, sans the vodka.\n\nBottom Line:  The bartender begrudingly adds vodka to my fruit juice, and tells me that he is \"only going to do it this time.\"\n\nThe dance floor is tiny, and no one starts dancing until about midnight or later - you know, once they get some liquid courage in them and start feelin' brave.  The clientele is a mix between wanna-be thugs, cholos, and some older folks, very reminicent of Toons! ; p\n\nThis place is under new management, as of a couple months ago, and it has gone downhill ever since.  I will NEVER patronize SJ Bar and Grill again.  For the $5.00 entrance fee, save yourself the headache and take your money to Smoke Tiki.\n\nWas this review …?",

There are also a few lame ones.  I think the good ones outweigh the bad.  \n\nTheir greasy food sometimes really hits the spot.  We lived around the corner and would frequent sjbg quite often for cheap food and drinks and to watch some kind of sporting event.\n\nI will say that the 2 times I came here on a Saturday night, I left feeling really good about myself because the crowd is pretty funky.

We walked into Tres Gringos on a Wednesday night realized they didn't sell pitchers unless you were going to play beer pong so we turned around and walked next door to San Jose bar and grill! As we were about to walk in the bouncer tells my friend he cant come in wearing sports attire. (he was wearing a 49rs jacket) We thought this was dumb because we had just walked in a moment earlier and no one had said anything. Anyway my friend went and left his jacket in the car and then he was allowed in. Later that night we see other dudes walk in with baseball caps and other clothing with sports logos. At this point we were all already eating a drinking so we were like that sucks, but whatever.\n\nPitcher of Blue Moon was 18 which I thought was a bit pricey but hey it was good beer. It was pretty empty when we got there around 10:30 which is what I expected on a wed night. We sat at the bar and received decent service. The only reason I say this is because I left my chicken wings unattended for a sec and before I knew it it had been cleaned out from the bar! Apparently I hadn't realized I was done :(   Other than that, bartenders were nice and prompt. They do have a special (don't know if its only on Wed's though) chicken wings=37.5 cents each and then they also have certain beers in a can for $2. Wish I had figured that out before I ordered the pitcher of Blue Moon.\n\nTo my surprise, at around 12:45 it began to get crowded. I guess ppl like to drink and have chicken wings in the early hours of the morning in San Jose,  who knows maybe I just had one to many beers and was seeing more people than where there?!\nOverall I had a good time",

They have the doors divided so that you can line up to enter on the left or exit on the right.  I step into the not-at-all-crowded \"exit\" area to finish my whole sixty seconds of conversation and immediately get interrupted by a bouncer telling me to move.  Okay, can't block the exit (even though I'm not blocking anyone), sure, no problem.. I'll move.  \n\nSo I step outside about 3 strides and finish my conversation in less than thirty seconds.  I turn around to walk back in and the same bouncer refuses to let me in the door he just practically pushed me out of!  I'm a nice guy and I figure the bouncers take shit all night, so I don't even give any attitude, just a quick: \"Seriously, dude?  I have to go get in line because I took a phone call?  You made me walk out here, even!\"  Nope, despite the fact that I have drinks I haven't paid for inside, I have to get back in the fairly long line just to show my ID again.  \n\nDid the only thing I could do.  Showed my ID, got back inside (to cries of \"where'd you go, man? damn!\") and told my story to my fellow barhoppers.  We all immediately settled our tabs, downed our drinks and left the place to spend our money in more pleasant havens.  Haven't been back since.  \n\n---\n\nJust to balance this out, my first couple of visits here were during the day.  It was quiet, just a few folks watching the TVs and drinking beer.  I ordered good food that was delivered fast, and the bartender kept the drinks coming.
